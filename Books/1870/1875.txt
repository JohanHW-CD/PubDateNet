                  the golden wheel of fortune shows:

 i. _whether you shall obtain the favor of the person you desire?_

 ii. _if the querent shall meet with the preferment he wisheth for?_

 iii. _whether a sick person will recover?_

 iv. _if the said sickness will be long or short?_

 v. _shall your expectation or wish succeed?_

 vi. _if it is good for you to marry, or otherwise?_

 vii. _whether the friendship of a certain person will prove
 advantageous or not?_

 viii. _whether a person shall be rich or poor? etc., etc._


               how to tell fortunes by the golden wheel.

the person whose fortune is to be told, must place the wheel of
fortune face downward, prick into a number (it is better to do it with
their eyes shut), then refer for an explanation, which stands at the
corresponding number as that you pricked into. (see frontispiece.)

_the following observations answer for either sex, the party,
therefore, trying this wheel, must alter wife for husband, or just as
the answers  suit either party._

                           what are dreams?


i offer you in this work, my dear reader, all that can be collected
in reference to dreams. notwithstanding the proverbial saying,  “all
dreams are lies,” we frequently see the realization of them, and by
them we are informed of more or less interesting events which afterward
happen to us. a prudent and enlightened man will therefore examine
carefully his dreams to know which he ought to interpret, neglecting
those which are extravagant because of too exalted an imagination or of
a disturbed digestion.

in consulting this book with attention, in seeking in it for the
explanation of your dreams, and calculating the causes which have
produced them, you will rarely depart from the truth, because you will
be following the rules of a wise combination, which will prevent you
from falling into an illusory if not fatal error.


              foreknowledge, or interpretation of dreams.

in the holy scriptures god says, that he  “will pour his spirit on all
flesh, that the young men and maidens shall prophesy, the old men shall
see visions, and the young men dream dreams.” both sacred and profane
history are full of so many examples of the fulfilment of dreams, that
he must be very skeptical and but little versed in natural science who
would refuse to have faith in them.

hippocrates says that when the body is asleep the soul is awake, and
transports itself everywhere, where the body would be able to go, that
it knows and sees all that the body could know or see were it awake;
that it touches all the body could touch, in a word, that it performs
all the actions that the body of a sleeping man could do were he awake.

there are five kinds of dreams, differently named according to their
different qualities. the first is dream, the second vision, the third
oracle, the fourth revery, and the fifth apparition.

a dream is that which, while we are asleep, shows us the truth hidden
under certain figures, as when joseph interpreted to king pharaoh the
dream concerning the seven lean kine that devoured the seven fat ones;
the dream of the seven full ears of corn, etc.

a vision is simply a dream happening when the body is awake instead of
sleeping, as vespasian when he saw the surgeon who had extracted nero’s
tooth.

the oracle is a revelation, or information given us by some angel or
other celestial spirit who does god’s bidding. the angel appearing to
joseph the husband of the virgin, and to the wise men, are examples of
this.

revery occurs when the passions are so vehement that they destroy the
mental equilibrium for a time. then what one thinks of during the day
he will dream of at night, as a lover who has been thinking during the
day of his beloved one will continue to do so at night while he is
sleeping. sometimes when one fears to meet a person, he will dream at
night that he has met him; having fasted during the day, he will dream
of eating, or, having been thirsty, of drinking. avarice will make the
miser dream of his gold, and speak of it when sleeping, as he would not
do when awake.

apparition is named phantom by the greeks, and is only that nocturnal
vision sometimes presented to children and weak-minded persons, who
imagine they see objects presented to intimidate or pain them.

of these five kinds of dreams, the three first have an appearance of
truth, but the last two are absolutely false.

it is to be remarked, with regard to all dreams, that those of which
only parts are remembered, signify nothing at all; that those that
memory retains are good and true; that they ought to occur about
day-break, or at least after midnight, because until that time the
senses and the body are occupied in the labor of digestion, and the
mind disturbed by the remembrance of dinner, can dream of nothing
reasonable. nevertheless artemidorus says, that a sober, temperate, and
tranquil man can dream at any hour of the night, or even during the
day, and that the fulfilment of such dreams will be certain.

some authors divide dreams into three kinds, namely, dreams of natural
objects, of animals, and of celestial objects. the natural things are
those by which physicians judge of the temperament; dreams of animals
show the passions and cares that the mind has felt during the day;
those of celestial objects are the intimations of divine things, as
for example, the statue that the king of babylon saw when asleep, which
is so well explained by the prophet daniel.

there are few persons who have the gift of dreaming that which will be
fulfilled, fewer still who know how to interpret them, because it is
necessary to observe many things not generally known.

there are two principal kinds of dreams, the speculative or
contemplative, and the allegorical or significative. to these one ought
to pay attention, the speculative happening in the fulfilment as it
occurred in dreams, for example: a prisoner in a small prison at paris
dreamed that a cord was being attached to his neck to hang him, that
after it was done a stranger appeared with a sword who severed the cord
and delivered him from death; this was fulfilled the next day, for the
judge having pronounced his sentence, and given him to the hangman, he
was delivered by unknown persons employed by his friends. allegorical
dreams on the contrary never happen as one has dreamed. thus, to dream
of an angel, signifies revelation or good news, but to see a serpent
which tries to bite one signifies troubles arising from the envy of
others.

speculative dreams are soon fulfilled, allegorical ones not so quickly;
a day or two often intervening between the dream and its completion.


                  about the interpretation of dreams.

 “dreams? nonsense!” i hear some grave-faced person cry. indeed!
and where did this grave-faced person learn his wisdom? not from
experience, i will engage. no, experience teaches us the reverse of
this. dreams are _by no means_ nonsense. this i maintain openly in the
face of all the world.

i maintain even that _every dream has its signification_. not that it
always discloses the future, i am far from asserting that. i say only
it _has its signification_. commonly a dream "permits us to cast a
glance into the soul or into the heart of man. the thoughts which dwell
in the former, and the feelings which sway the latter, shape themselves
in sleep into various images, which throw a strong light upon the
character. there have no doubt been many extravagant fictions palmed
off as facts relative to dreams, but yet enough credible evidence
exists of their importance to make any strange dream the subject of
reflection and examination on the part of the dreamer; and it cannot be
denied that many things in our dreams are actually omens.


 a list of dreams, with their true interpretation, together with
 the lucky numbers of the lottery which they signify.

above. to dream you see any thing hanging _above_ you signifies you
will improve in your worldly prospects, and soon be in a better
situation than you were before you had the dream. 76, 62, 14.

absence. to dream of absent persons, signifies that they will soon
return. it also denotes success in business. 4, 22.

abscess. if you dream you have an abscess, or running sore on your
person, it foretells good fortune and good health, to be preceded by
sickness. 3, 27.

abuse. to dream that you are abused and insulted, is a sign that some
dispute will happen between you and some person with whom you have
business; if you are in love, be assured that some one has attempted to
injure you with the object of your affections, and that they have in a
great measure succeeded. 6, 38, 44.

abundance. if you dream you have an over-abundance of any thing, it
goes by contrary, and is a sign of a scarcity; as if a farmer should
dream that he had a great crop, it would predict a scarcity—not perhaps
of that particular article of which he dreamed, but of something that
would be important to him. 15.

abyss. to see an abyss, or deep hole, is a warning; avoid, after such
a dream, taking a journey by land, or a voyage by sea, for eight-and
forty hours, because it forebodes accidents by travelling. 62, 19.

accident. to dream that an accident has happened to you, or to any one
of your household, or with whom you live, foretells that you will see
some one whom you little expect to see. 72, 3, 11.

accounts. dreams that relate to making up accounts are good omens. if
you dream you found an error in your money account, it foretells that
you will have a piece of good luck. accounts blotted with ink is a sign
of sickness. 14.

accuse. to dream a person accuses you of any thing, is favorable to the
dreamer. 66, 4.

acorn. (_see oak._) to dream you see swine eating acorns denotes that
you will have reverses in business, and lose if you are not very
careful; to dream of picking acorns signifies that a rich relative will
leave you a fortune. 65.

acquaintance. to dream you quarrel or fight with an acquaintance,
forebodes divisions in your own family; in love, unfaithfulness; and
losses in business. 42, 6.

actress. if you dream you love her, it is a sign you will meet with
adversities. if you dream you see her on the stage you will be
successful in all your undertakings. 68, 5, 18.

adder. to dream of this reptile is a sign that some one whom you think
friendly to you will injure you in some way. 19, 2.

adultery. it is in most cases a bad omen to dream that you have
perpetrated this act. if the person you dreamed about is married, or
is a prostitute, you  almost be sure that some misfortune will
overtake you. if she is a virgin, it merely predicts that you will
shortly have an invitation to a wedding. for a married woman to dream
of adultery is a sign she will soon conceive and have a girl. to an
unmarried woman such a dream is a sign of misfortune. 51, 7, 3.

ague. to dream that you have one, warns you against an inclination to
strong drink; to dream your sweetheart has an ague, denotes affection
and happiness. 39, 6, 1.

air. to dream that you see it clear and serene, shows that you shall
be beloved and esteemed by most people; if at law, success. in short,
all good is denoted by clear and serene air. but to dream that the air
is thick, cloudy, dark, and troubled, denotes to the dreamer, grief,
sickness, loss of good, hindrance of business, and crosses in love. 12,
9.

almonds. signify riches and happiness; to eat them shows you will have
good luck in love matters. 73, 18, 10.

alligator. (_see reptile._)

alms. to dream they are begged of you, and you refuse them, shows want
and misery to the dreamer; but to dream you give them freely, is a sign
of joy and long life. 11, 13, 4.

altar. to dream of an altar, betokens gladness, and affection in love.
of an _ark_, the same. 71, 63, 4.

anchor. to dream you see one, signifies unexpected success in love; but
in business, it shows the success to be distant, and only obtainable
with care. 47, 36.

angel. to dream you see angels in your sleep, is a sign some are near
you, and that the rest of your dream will come to pass. to see many
angels, is a sign of many children, and much prosperity. 16, 8, 24.

anger. (_see rage._) to dream that you have been provoked to anger,
shows that you have powerful enemies; and warns you to be careful that
all you do should be strictly honorable; but it also signifies you will
hear good news, and be in a good humor. 44, 16.

angling. (_see fish._)

ants. to dream of ants, is unlucky; and to dream too often of them,
shows the dreamer not to be long lived. 7, 49, 20.

apes. (_see monkey._) to dream you have seen or had any thing to do
with them, signifies malicious, though secret enemies; and warns you
against carrying on law-suits. 17, 6.

apparition. to dream you see an apparition or spirit, clothed in white,
signifies deceit, temptation to sin, and disappointment in love. 57.

the following is an old prediction in verse:

  to dream of seeing strange apparitions,
  as devils, hobgoblins, and such visions,
  does show thy love, or thy sweetheart,
  hath a fair face, but devil’s heart.

apparel. (_see silks and satins._) to dream that your clothes are
good, denotes prosperity and happiness; of white apparel, is good only
for clergymen; to others it is a sign of trouble; to mechanics, decline
of business; to the sick, death. if of black, however, it is of their
recovery; of rich scarlet apparel, is good for rich men, signifying
honor; but is death to the sick, and loss or captivity to the poor; to
dream of women’s apparel, is good for the unmarried; but to a married
man loss of his wife or sickness. 17, 20.

apples, or apple-trees. (_see orchard._) if sweet, denote joy and
pleasure, especially to women and maids. sour apples signify contention
and sedition. 4, 11, 44.

apricots. content, health, and pleasure, if in season; if otherwise,
vain hopes, bad fortune. 22, 5, 64.

arms. to dream your arms are withered or lean, denotes affliction,
sickness and poverty; and if a woman, she is in danger of being a
widow. if any person dream his arms are hairy it denotes increase of
riches. 7.

armed men. (_see zouave._)

ashes. great misfortune is at hand; to a lover or sweetheart, such a
dream forebodes that he or she will be jealous because of seeing some
one in company with their intended. 70.

asp. to dream of the asp or adder, is a sign of designing enemies; but
it is good, if they do not bite you. 17, 4.

of a lawsuit. 20, 1.

foretells thrift. if she is a farmer’s wife, it is a sign of good
crops. if she burns her bread it is a sign that she will have a
miscarriage. 18, 54.

ball. (_see dancing._) if you dream you are at a ball, and are dancing
with a lady, it is a sign you will marry her; if you dream that she is
gone, and you are looking round to find her and cannot, it foretells

he or she has been talking bad about you. if a girl should ever be

your undertaking and  possibly fail in it. 5, 55.

break off the intimacy. 20.

heart shows you are doomed to suffer through treachery. 46, 11.

talked about as suspicious. 45, 78.

foretells luck and success: but if you see lean and hungry-looking hogs

runaway match. 2, 10.

will give you great joy or pleasure. to a young girl it is a sign that

  a lover soon the question pops!
  and marries, too, with quick dispatch—
  nine children fair will bless that match!

horns. to see horns on the head of another person, danger to the
dreamer on your own wealth and importance. to dream you are gored by a
horned animal denotes unhappiness. to lovers it usually predicts that
they will have difficulty in connection with their desires; if they

union, though perhaps not prevent it in the end. 9, 18, 36.

horse. if you dream of riding well and easily on the back of this
noble animal, your fortune is sure to advance in the world: but if you

you will make money by some speculation, or else by selling property.
horses are excellent animals to dream about. 2, 11, 22.

the same sign holds good with the other sex. 2, 11.

hungry. (_see fast._) to dream of being hungry foretells that you
will soon engage in some new enterprise which will prove successful.

affectionate manner as to win her heart. 19, 37.

cheat you in some way. such a dream is a bad omen to loves, as it

much happiness; if the light begins to disappear, sorrow and many tears
will be your portion. 24, 68.

impertinence. if a girl dreams that she meets a gentleman who is
impertinent toward her in conversation, it is a sign she will make a
new male acquaintance who will be very agreeable to her: if she gets
angry at the said impertinence she will probably fall in love with her
new friend and either marry him or be on improper intimate terms with
him. 1, 11.

indigo. to dream of indigo, denotes to a female that she will cross the

business. to the single it is a sign they will soon fall in love and
be fortunate in their courtship. to the married it denotes domestic
happiness. 4, 75, 30.

ivy. to dream of seeing this vine running over and covering any house,
is a sign of poverty, particularly if the ivy grows thick and abundant:
if you dream that it covers your own house, the sign is still more
sure: for a farmer to dream that he sees ivy covering a tree, denotes
bad crops. a girl who dreams of being in a bower covered with ivy, will
probably marry a poor and shiftless man. 2.

jail. (_see prison._) if a man dreams he is confined in a prison or
jail, it shows that he will have honors or dignities conferred upon
him, as such dreams go contrariwise: if his arrest and imprisonment
worries him, it only shows that he will be the more delighted with his
new dignities. 46.

jar. to dream that a house is jarred or shook by an earthquake, an
explosion, or anything that  occur outside, is a sign that the head
of the family in that house will be sick. jars of preserved fruit

presented with one or more of them, it shows you will be long lived and
thrifty. 15, 39.

eating jelly, and that plenty of it is around, is a sure sign of long

rule applies to preserved fruits. 65, 18, 78.

jew. if you dream that a genuine israelite comes along and annoys you
in any way, it is a sign you will quarrel with your father; if you
imagine that he cheats you in a bargain, it predicts that you will
probably receive a present from some near relative; on the contrary, if
he gives you an advantage in the bargain, it shows that your father, or
some elderly relative, will ask a favor of you. 58, 21.

jewels. chains, pearls, or precious stones, etc., and all adornings
upon the heads and necks of women, are good dreams for the fair sex; to

themselves, it is a sign, that you will either travel in distant
countries or be very discontented at home. 36, 75.

keg. to dream of an empty one is a sign you will soon leave home; a
keg of small fish, or oysters, denotes the receipt of money; a keg
of spirits of any kind, promises poverty; a keg of powder foretells
misfortune; a keg of paint predicts compliments to be paid you. 14.

key. if you dream of finding a key, or a bunch of keys, it is a sign
that some one will tell you a secret; to dream of losing a key, or
keys, is a bad omen, as it predicts that you will come to shame. such a
dream is particularly unfortunate to a young lady. 41, 8.

kid. to dream of a young and sportful kid, implies the birth of a
child. a young girl who grants her lover too close intimacy before
marriage should never dream of the innocent and harmless kid. it is a

be disappointed. if you dream you speak to a king it is a happy omen,

predicts bad luck and poverty; but if the killing be done by accident,
it shows that, though you  have a misfortune in consequence, it will
not materially affect your interest. for butchers or farmers to dream
of killing fat and healthy animals for food, is a sign of thrift and
abundance; but if they dream of killing a hog that does not squeal, it
shadows forth a death in the family. 41.

kissing. (_see stranger._) dreams of kissing work curiously: if a
girl dreams that she is kissed by a young man in whom she takes no
particular interest, it  be a good omen, and it  not; for if he
happens to be a silly fellow who imagines that she is in love with
him, it is a sign she will be slandered in a way that will make her
unhappy; but if he has no such sentiment, then the sign is exactly the
reverse—that is, some one will speak well of her to those whom she
esteems highly—perhaps to her lover. if a girl dreams she is kissed by
her lover, it predicts that he will say something unpleasant to her at
their next meeting; if a lover dreams that his sweetheart kisses him
the sign is similar. 1.

kite in the air, predicts that she will receive a letter from a young
man—whether a lover or not, is uncertain. 53, 62.

signifies that he will try and seduce her. 27, 9.

ladder. to dream of going up a ladder signifies that you will be
a person of some consequence, yet poor: if you imagine you are in

will attempt to injure you; if you dream of going down a ladder it

her, foretells departure. 47, 51, 11.

lake. if you dream of sailing on a smooth and clear lake, it
foreshadows success in all your undertakings; if the lake is rough,
but yet has clear water, the sign still holds good, though you will
encounter difficulties; if it is muddy water, it denotes sickness, and
losses through dishonest people about you. 49, 17.

lambs. to see young lambs frisking around their mother, is an excellent
omen, as it denotes thrift, and also happiness in your family ties; if
you see them sucking, it is a sign of an increase in your family by
the birth of a child. for lovers to dream of young lambs, foretells a
speedy and happy marriage. 24, 60.

lamp. to dream of dropping or breaking a lighted lamp, denotes
disappointment. if, in your dream, you see the bright light of a lamp
at a distance from you in the dark, and you approach it, it shows that
you will either have good luck, or will be invited to visit somewhere
and meet an agreeable person of the opposite sex. 19.

land. to dream of buying or inheriting land, is an excellent omen, as
it foretells health and wealth; but to sell land in your dream, denotes
sickness and poverty. if a young man dreams of buying land, it is a
sign he will marry a rich wife. 34, 61, 18.

lantern. to dream of carrying a lantern in a dark night is a good sign,
provided you have no difficulty in finding your way, for it shows

in view; if you stumble, or have difficulty in finding your way with
the lantern, it denotes trouble and vexation, though success will be
achieved at last. 28, 10.

lark. to dream of the lark, shows speedy increase of fortune. to
lovers, this is a very favorable omen, and is a sign that the course of
true love runs smooth. 47, 68.

him for a stranger; to the married it signifies domestic trouble. 40.

laurel or olive. denotes victory and pleasure; to the married,
inheritance and children; to the single, marriage. 71, 13, 1.

law. to dream of instituting a suit at law, or entering a criminal
complaint against any one, shows that some enemy will injure you

reverse; you will probably receive money unexpectedly, or be uncommonly
successful in your pursuits. 21, 8.

lawyer. to dream of meeting a lawyer, brings bad tidings; if you speak
to him, you will lose some property; if you hear some one speaking in
his favor, you will meet with some misfortune. 16.

lazy. to dream that you see lazy people lounging around, and that you
are vexed with them, is a sign of bad luck to some of your relatives,
who will depend upon you to assist them: if, in your dream, you imagine
yourself to be lazy and sleepy over your work, it foretells either
sickness or that you will meet with a loss. 62, 39, 69.

that you will encounter many difficulties in your present pursuits and
that your sweetheart will not marry you. 9, 31.

is a good sign, and shows you will live long and be happy; but to see
leaves wither and fall to the ground, is a sign of sickness and death.
47, 21.

legs. to dream of thick and fat legs is a bad omen, as it foreshadows
sickness: thin, spindleshank legs are excellent ones to dream about, as
they denote a successful race with fortune. it is not to be supposed
that a lover will ever dream of his sweetheart’s legs, but if he should
do so, he will probably imagine them to be round, plump, and of an
alabaster whiteness; this is a bad dream, and he should by all means
avoid thinking of her legs when he goes to sleep: if a lady dreams that
her lover’s legs are thin, it foretells that he will be a rich man. 48,
5.

lemons. to dream of lemons denotes contentions in your family and
uneasiness on account of children; they announce the death of some

receive a great number of letters, it foretells that honors await you:
to receive one letter in your dream, denotes that some one is praising
you behind your back. if a girl dreams that she receives a love-letter
from her beau, it shows that he adores her: a gentleman who has a
similar dream of a letter from his sweetheart,  rest satisfied that
he only possesses her heart. 28, 54, 1.

from an absent one whom you love. 18, 50.

far as the crops are concerned. 77, 5, 15.

linen. to dream you are arrayed in clean linen denotes that you
will shortly receive some glad tidings; and that your sweetheart is
faithful; if it is dirty, then it denotes poverty and disappointment
in love. white linen, if dressed in it, presages death; colored linen,
removal; shifts, a gay sweetheart; gowns, a gift. 24, 71.

lion. if you dream of seeing the king of beasts, and if he is mild and
gentle looking, it shows that you will easily rise in the world to a
better position than you now occupy: to dream of an angry and roaring
lion, who tries to get at you, shows, that although you  rise in
position, jealous people will annoy and try to injure you. 14.

  nests of wasps or hornets, these
  are emblems whereby are expressed
  discord with those whom you love best.

signifies that you will be surrounded with false friends, who will rob
you until your property dwindles to a shadow. to dream you see your

portends death. if a girl dreams she sees her lover in a looking-glass,
it is a sign he will desert or seduce her. 18, 61.

losses. to dream of losing your hat is a sign you will entertain a
large company, either by making a speech, or otherwise attracting their
attention: dreaming of the loss of money, a watch, or any valuables of
that kind, predicts that you will gain as much and perhaps more than
your loss amounts to: if a girl dreams of losing her shoe-strings, she
will be kissed by an agreeable young man; any article of clothing that
you  dream of having lost, shows that you will rig yourself out in a
new suit. 47, 6.

lottery. (_see prize._)

love. to dream you are in love is a sign you will make a fool of
yourself and do something silly, of which you  afterwards be
ashamed—thus showing that the dream works contrariwise—for love is

girl to dream of falling in love foretells that she will be laughed at
and ridiculed for some folly. 64, 52, 1.

luck. to imagine in your dream that you have had excellent luck, in any
enterprise, predicts a misfortune: if a man has had a quarrel with his

to dream of a murdered man, is a sign of long life. to dream you meet a

tradesmen and others who have notes to pay. 31, 9.

marriage. (_see wedding._) if any one should be so unfortunate as to
dream that he or she was present at a happy and jolly wedding, it
denotes that they will attend a funeral; it will not necessarily be at

you will undoubtedly be called to mourn some friend or relative. to
dream of being married yourself, foretells your death. 2, 78, 42.

mask. to dream you see a person wearing a mask, is a sign of hypocrisy;

in business and love affairs. to dream you are making a quill pen, is
a sign you have many enemies, but that you will triumph over them, and
be successful in all you undertake. but this dream does not amount to
much, as it is only a  “set-off” to dreaming of a pen-knife, which is a
bad omen. 28, 6.

peppers. to dream of picking pepper-pods, foretells to married people
smart children, if they have any. a girl who dreams this, will have
a smart man for a lover, but he will not pet her much either as a
sweetheart or wife. 9.

perfumery. to dream of pleasant and delicate perfumes, foreshadows
sluttish habits in a woman: if a lover dreams of perfumes in connection
with the beloved object, it shows that when he marries, he will find
her to be a slut. a girl who dreams this, will be apt to have a
shiftless lover. 71, 1.

perjury. to dream that any one injures you by false swearing, or by
perjury in court, is a sign that you will discover some friend or
acquaintance to be dishonest, or guilty of a crime, or of mean conduct;
if a girl dream this, it is a similar omen relative to her lover. 52.

pet. if a girl dreams she has a pet animal of any kind, (a child, of
course, excepted,) it is a sign she will never marry: if she dreams of
a pet child, or one whom she adores, it foretells for her a prolific
marriage. 49.

physic. (_see medicine._) in a dream-book published , is this
prediction:  “if any man doth dreme he taketh much physicke, it
foretelleth a bad lyver, and a quarell with ye doctor; but a virgin
who dremeth this dreme, will marry ye doctor first, and quarell
thereafter.” 37, 8.

piano. to dream of hearing pleasant and lively tunes on the piano, is a
sign of thrift and domestic happiness; but if you dream of buying, or
that any one presents you with a piano, it foreshadows poverty; it is a
bad omen for a girl to dream she has got a new piano. 72.

pickles. if a girl dreams of eating pickles, it is a sign some old
bachelor will kiss her: if a young man dreams of pickles, he will
be beloved by a maid older than himself, and probably of a sour and
crabbed temper. 39, 2.

48, 7.

pies. to dream of eating pie is a sign that you will soon be in want.
to dream you are making pies is a sign of pleasure and happiness. 38.

pigeons. to dream of pigeons is a sign of content and delight, and
success in business. 39.

pigs. to dream of seeing pigs is good; if you are in trade you will
have great increase in your business from foreign parts; if you are
in love, your sweetheart is thereby denoted to be of a good temper,
faithful and sincere to you, and that if you marry you will become
happy. 4, 12, 48.

pineapple. to dream of this fruit is a sign of gold; if you see an
abundance of it, you will receive plenty of gold soon after: a young
girl who dreams of pineapples will probably get a rich husband. 22, 9,
78.

pinks. if a lady dreams of pinks, it foretells she will soon have a new
bonnet that she will be delighted with: if a gentleman dreams of them,
his wife or sweetheart will get a new bonnet that will please him.
that’s all. 34.

pins. to dream of pins signifies that you will have small troubles all
through life, but no great disasters; to dream you find a pin is a sign
of success in business; if a girl dream she is pricked with a pin, she
must keep a sharp look out for her lover or she  get in trouble. 3,
71.

pipe. to dream you smoke a pipe is an omen of success in business; if

prospects. 49, 7, 9.

leave her a fortune. 6.

piss-abed. to dream that you wet the bed in your sleep, is a sign you
will lose something by fire: your house  not burn, but some article
will either fall in the fire or be damaged by it—perhaps your servant
 spoil some clothing while ironing. 5, 11, 55.

pistol. to dream of arming yourself with a pistol foretells that you
will lose _caste_, and perhaps become poor: if a girl dreams that her
lover carries a pistol, she  be sure that he is below her in social
life, and therefore an unpropitious or unsuitable match. 16, 21, 57.

pitch. to dream that you get pitch on your person is a sign that some
one has been scandalizing you by telling lies: a girl who dreams this,
 be sure that her fair fame has been questioned somewhere. 54, 14.

pitcher. (_see jug._) to dream you drink water or milk from a pitcher
is a good omen, and signifies you will be prosperous in love and
business. to dream you spill anything out of a pitcher foretells losses
from the treachery of supposed friends, and to dream you break a
pitcher portends sickness, and accident while on a journey. to dream of
breaking a pitcher is also a sign of bankruptcy through carelessness.
49, 20.

plains. to dream of being on a beautiful plain signifies health,
happiness and riches, but portends some crosses in love. 4, 12, 48.

  dreams of wandering over plains,
  walking in cross ways and lanes,
  and being in thick woods quite lost,
  declare that lovers shall be crost.

plants. (_see blossom._) to dream of healthy, thriving plants is a
good omen, as it foretells success in life, and smart children: such a
dream is an excellent one for lovers, as it denotes an early and happy
marriage. 43, 14, 7.

plaster. for a girl to dream of having a plaster on her person is a

to his wife or sweetheart. 72, 8.

plenty. (_see abundance._)

plow. (_see husbandry._)

plowing. for a farmer to dream that he is plowing on smooth and even
ground, denotes heavy crops, and good luck generally: if he plows up
stones it is all the better, but if his plow gets hitched into a rock
or stump, it denotes vexation and trouble with his good luck. 41.

plums. to dream of an abundance of this fruit is a sign of health but
yet you are liable to lose your life by an accident: if a girl dreams
she is presented with plums, it foretells her early death. 36, 14, 77.

pocket-book. to dream of finding a pocket-book full of money is a sign
of riches, but if it contains no money, it foretells a disappointment:
if you dream you lose your pocket-book, it foreshadows success in
business. 19, 78.

poet. if any young person should be so silly as to dream of writing
poetry, it foretells poverty; and for one to dream of having a
poetical lover or sweetheart, is a sign that they will fall in love
with a fool. 64, 50.

poison. to dream that you are poisoned is a sign you will get into bad
or unworthy company: if you imagine that any friend or acquaintance is
poisoned, it is a similar omen as regards them: if, in your dream, you
think any one has given you poison to murder you, it foretells that
some base proposal will be made to you. 3, 9.

pole-cat. if a man dream he sees one, he will marry a beautiful woman;
if a woman, she will marry a handsome man. if this delightful animal
make an attack on you it is a sign you will suffer from the slander of
enemies. 68, 2.

police. if any respectable person dreams of being arrested by police
officers, it is a sign that some distinguished honor will be conferred
on him: if a young girl should dream that policemen took her lover into
custody, she will hear of his advancement in the world. 46, 30.

polite. to dream of polite people is a sign that a stranger will visit,
or be introduced to you: if a girl dreams that her beau is stiff and
formal in addressing her, it foretells that she will soon have a new
admirer. 61.

poor. to dream of poverty is a sign of good luck, but if you imagine
you are so poor as to be induced to beg, it foretells that some one
will either insult you or hurt your feelings, but yet your luck will
not be impaired. 8, 2.

pork. (_see bacon and ham._)

portrait. to dream of having your portrait taken, is a sign some one
will compliment your good looks; but if you are dissatisfied and think
it a bad likeness, the compliment will run in a contrary direction, and
you will be called frightfully ugly-looking behind your back. 12.

pound. for a farmer to dream that any of his cattle are taken to pound,
is a sign that they will increase: if he dreams of seeing strange
cattle in a pound, it foretells that he will soon buy some. 19, 55.

praise. to dream that any one praises or flatters you, is a sign of
scandal: if a girl dreams that her lover praises her good looks or
amiability, she bad better discard him as a false-hearted person who
cares nothing about her, but is merely flattering his own vanity. 35,
17.

prayer. to dream of prayer, or of joining in a prayer with others, is a
sign you will ask a favor of some one who will refuse you: if you dream
of hearing prayers at church, or in any public place, it shows that
you will be requested to do something which you will refuse to do, and
thereby make an enemy. 34, 77.

pregnancy. for a woman to dream that she is pregnant when she is not,
is a sign of some special good fortune; she will either have a handsome
present, or else her husband will be lucky in some business transaction
and give her a part of the money: if a girl dreams this, it foretells
that she will get married about as sudden as if the dream were a
reality. 4, 11, 44.

present. (_see gift._) to dream of receiving a present, is usually
a sign of disappointment; but if a married woman dreams that she is
presented with fruit, it shows that she will soon become pregnant: if
a girl imagines she is presented by her lover with gold jewelry, it
predicts that he covets the possession of her person rather than her
heart. 64, 21.

preserves. to dream that you make or eat them, foretells the
acquisition of much money and property, also health and happiness. 3,
33, 9.

pretty girl. for a young man to dream of admiring a pretty girl, is a
sign he will marry a simpleton: if a girl dreams she has a nice and
pretty-looking lover, she will be apt to take up with a putty-head.
here is an ancient rhyming prediction: 4, 13.

  to dream you love a girl who’s pretty,
    foretells that you’ll in sorrow part;
  but if you dream she’s wise and witty,
    she’ll be the darling of your heart!

prick. if a lady dreams of pricking her finger while sewing, she must
put it in her mouth on awaking, and make a wish, and she will realize
it within one month, provided it relates to love matters: a wish of any
other kind will doubtless come true some time or other, as the omen is
an excellent one: if a lady dreams she pricks herself with a pin, the
omen is not so good. (_see pin and briar._) 498.

priest. to dream that a priest offers you service, or visits you for
any purpose, is a sign that you will be robbed; if you dream you go to
one for advice, it foretells that some misfortune will overtake you:
any dream about a priest is a bad one. 39.

prison. (_see jail._) to dream you are put in prison, foretells that
honor awaits you: but this omen does not apply to rogues or dishonest
people, though such a dream by them favors their desires: if a girl
dreams that her lover has gone to prison, she will soon hear of his
advancement. 46.

prize. to dream of drawing a prize in the lottery, is a sign of poverty
and misery: if you dream that you bought a lottery ticket with a
majority of odd numbers on it, you  perchance be successful with
those numbers, but even numbers are worthless in dreams. to dream of
getting prizes in any way is a bad omen. 4, 11, 44.

procession. to dream of seeing a long military or civic procession,
is a sign that some of your friends will come to poverty and ask your
assistance; if you imagine that you are in such a procession yourself,
it foretells that you will either make a loss, or be very short of
money. 2.

profit. if a man dreams that he made a large and liberal profit by any
transaction or speculation, it foretells losses and disaster. 48, 16.

that he will confer a benefit on you: if a girl dreams that her lover
has broken his promise to marry, it foreshadows a speedy performance of
the ceremony. 3.

property. to dream of the loss of property, is a sign of good luck, and
you  calculate to acquire as much as you dreamed was lost, for such
dreams always work contrariwise. 45, 1, 14.

prostitute. for a young man to dream of associating with prostitutes,
is a sign of poverty and disgrace: if he dreams of seeing these girls
anywhere, it foretells misfortune or bad luck: for a girl to dream of
them, is a sign that her chastity is in danger. 35, 9.

proud. to dream of proud people who disgust you, foretells that you
will rise in the world: a girl who dreams this of her lover, will
probably marry a rich or distinguished man. 3, 32, 13.

pudding. to dream of a hard-boiled plum pudding, or a hard roll of
pudding of any kind, is a sign you will be invited to a dinner party;
but if you imagine the pudding looks soft and mussy, it foretells that
you will go to some entertainment where there will be a row. 19, 70.

pulpit. if any one dreams of going into a pulpit, it is a sign he or
she will visit a place of disrepute, as such dreams work contrariwise:
for a girl to dream that she assists in ornamenting or dressing a
pulpit, foretells that she will do some act that she afterwards
regrets, because of an unworthy person being connected therewith. 62.

pump. dreaming of a pump is an excellent omen: if you dream of
pumping clear water from one, it shows that you will have good luck
in business, or in a speculation: pumping dirty water is a sign of
sickness. 29, 4, 20.

punch. to dream of making this beverage, or of drinking it, is a sign
of poverty or disgrace; if a girl dreams that her lover treats her to
punch, she had better discard him at once, as he will undoubtedly turn
out to be a poor and shiftless fellow. 19, 32.

punishment. (_see stick._) to dream of punishing a child, foretells
good fortune to the victim, and honors to yourself. for any one to
dream of being punished by whipping, is a sign they will rise in the
world, or be honored for some act. 7.

purse. to dream of finding an empty purse, shadows forth
disappointment; if the purse has plenty of money in it, your luck will
be excellent—the more money, the better fortune: if it has in it large
gold pieces, or large bills, you will become rich either by marriage or
inheritance. 78.

putty. to dream of putty, is a sign of poverty: puttying up holes
foretells losses—the larger the hole, the more extensive the loss. if
you are putting glass into a window with putty, it foretells that you
will soon remove into a meaner place than you now occupy. 6, 4.

puzzle. to dream of bothering your brains with a puzzle, foretells
frivolity; if you succeed, you will do something that works to your
disadvantage: if you imagine that the puzzle puzzles you, it is a sign
that some silly person will do you an unintentional injury. 21, 17.

quail. to dream of these birds is a good omen: if you imagine you see
young quail feeding, it is a sign of thrift, particularly to farmers:
to be successful in shooting them in the proper season, also foretells
good luck and success in any undertaking. 76, 14.

quaker. to dream of business intercourse with genuine broad-brims,
is a sign you will make a bad bargain. if, in your dream, you see a
concourse of quakers, it foretells that you will not be fortunate in
business matters. this omen is supposed to be predicated on the fact
that the quakers monopolize all the good chances when they are around.
24, 30.

quarrel. to dream of quarreling with a stranger, is a sign you will
make a new friend or acquaintance; if you imagine that you quarrel with
a friend, it shows that you will soon have a pleasant and agreeable
time with him: lovers who dream of quarrels, will be apt to bill and
coo harder than ever. 2, 12, 24.

queen. for a man to dream of seeing a queen, foretells the loss of
money, either by robbery or bad debts: if he is presented to a queen,
the dream is still worse in respect to losses. 39, 60.

quicksilver. (_see metals._)

quilting. if a lady dreams of going to a quilting party, it foretells
for her and her family thrift and good luck: gentlemen, who dream of
being much entertained at such a party, will have the very best success
in love matters. 71, 54.

quinces. to dream of quinces, is an excellent omen: if you imagine you
are gathering quinces from trees full of fine-looking, yellow ones, it
predicts that you will get just so much yellow gold, which will be a
fortune. 49, 6.

quoits. if a man dreams he is playing quoits, it is a sign he will soon
have a quarrel. if a woman dreams she is playing quoits, it foretells
she will have much trouble through life. to dream of quoits, is not a
good omen to lovers. 57, 3.

rabbits. to dream of these animals, foretells many small children: if
a newly married woman dreams of them it is a sign that she will have
twins or triplets within a year: such a dream will not be very pleasant
to a young girl unless she means to marry right sudden, for rabbits do
not predict anything else but breeding children. 44, 13.

raccoon. to dream of simply treeing a raccoon, is a good omen, for you
will probably either gain a sum of money, or have it left to you as a
legacy: if you imagine that you shoot the animal, and he falls to the
ground, this will spoil the luck; you should stop dreaming as soon as
the ’coon is up the tree. 61, 12.

races. (_see run._) to dream of running a race on foot and winning
it, is a sign of success in any undertaking—losing it, foretells
disappointment. if you dream of going to a horse-race, it predicts
poverty and shiftlessness. 46, 7.

radishes. to dream of this vegetable, signifies that a secret will be
discovered, which will occasion a muss in the family. to a girl, it is
a sign she will lose her beau, and to a lover, it foreshadows he will
be  “cut out” by some other nice young man. 38, 13.

raffle. raffling in your dream is the same as gambling; it foretells
poverty and disgrace: to dream of raffling for poultry is a sign that
your family (if you have one) will want bread; if you are single, it
shows that you will be apt to get seedy and loaferish. 8, 44.

raft. to dream of seeing a raft foretells a journey—the longer the
raft, the more extensive the line of travel: if you dream of sailing
on a raft, it is a sign you will travel, with good success, in distant
countries. 10.

rage. (_see anger._) if you dream that you are in a great rage in
consequence of a mishap, or disagreeable event, it is a sign that some
pleasant episode in connection therewith will occur to put you in an
excellent humor, as such dreams work contrariwise. 44, 16.

ragged. to dream that your clothes are ragged, indicates that a young
girl will banter you: if, in your dream, you see ragged people, it is a
sign that you will suffer ridicule at your next meeting with a party of
ladies and gentlemen. rags and ridicule go together in dreams. 19.

railroad. to dream of traveling by railroad, foretells to people who
keep house that they will break up their establishment: to young
persons it indicates the loss of their home: to lovers it is a sign
that if they marry they will not keep house long, if at all. 3, 11, 33.

rain. to dream of a gentle rain is a good omen, as it foretells success
in any undertaking: if you dream of a violent rain-storm accompanied
by wind and thunder and lightning, it predicts much trouble and
misfortune, though ultimate success in your undertakings. 21, 72.

rainbow. it is an excellent dream to imagine you see a brilliant
rainbow—the brighter the better: it denotes health and general
prosperity: to lovers it foretells a happy marriage, and riches. a
young girl who dreams of a rainbow will either get an agreeable lover
or a present. 45.

raking. for a girl to dream of raking newly mown hay, is a sign she
will be married before the hay is eaten: young fellows who dream of
raking hay with their sweethearts had better get ready their necks for
the matrimonial noose, as they are past praying for. 4, 11.

ram. to dream that a ram runs at you for butting purposes, shadows
forth to a young man that his society will be coveted by the girls, and
that he will be fortunate in love matters generally: if a girl dreams
this, she will probably have her choice of lovers, as all the young
fellows around there will fall in love with her: if the ram succeeds in
butting her, she will surely be taken captive and brought as cupid’s
prisoner into the matrimonial ranks. 19.

rape. if a female (married or single) dreams of an outrage on her
person, (whether attempted, or successful,) it is a sign that some one
of the opposite sex is in love with her: if she is married, the dream
alludes to some man other than her husband. such dreams bode no good.
31.

raspberries. to dream of an abundance of this fruit is a sign of health
and riches: if you dream you are eating raspberries, it shows that you
will be engaged in some enterprise that will bring you in a good deal
of cash, most of which will be spent lavishly. 3, 66.

rats. (_see trap and mouse._) to dream of rats is a sign that thieves
are around: if you see any of these animals, it shows that some friend
will be robbed, but if you hear them gnawing, you will suffer a loss
from robbery yourself. if a girl, who has a lover, dreams of rats, she
had better be careful and not let him be too free with her person, or
he  rob her of that which cannot be restored. 54, 21.

raven. (_see crow._)

reading. to dream you are reading, indicates you will be successful in
your love; in trade, it is particularly propitious; but if it appear to
be painful or irksome to read, it signifies that you shall not succeed
without exertion, 65, 2.

reaping. (_see harvest._) to dream of reaping grain is an excellent
omen, as it foretells thrift and abundance, as well as plenty of money
in gold; this applies to a prolific field of ripe yellow grain; if the
grain is meagre and looks rusty, the sign is entirely different, as it
betokens scarcity and penury. 4, 11, 44.

relations. if you dream of being annoyed at home by your relations,
it is a sign that you will be the subject of much scandal: if, on the
contrary, you imagine that your relatives visit you and give you great
pleasure by their society, it foretells that you are talked about a
good deal, but always with respect and veneration. 70.

religious. for any one to dream of becoming religious, foretells that
they will be cheated or swindled in some way, as such a dream works
contrariwise: if you dream that a minister, or any religious person,
exhorts you to become pious, you had better look out sharp, for some
rogue is around, contriving how to victimize you. 54.

rent. to dream of paying your rent foretells that you will get some
money unexpectedly; but if you dream that you owe it, without having
the money to pay, and are worried in consequence, it foreshadows a loss
of property. 3.

reprieve. if a criminal under sentence of death dream of a reprieve or
pardon, he  make up his mind that it is all over with him; and if
any friend, who is interested in his fate, dreams this, it amounts to
about the same thing. 76, 5.

reptile. to dream of any animal that is called a reptile, such as
snakes, toads, alligators, and the like, is a sign of a quarrel: if you
imagine you are bitten, it shows that you will come out second best,
or badly injured either in person or reputation. if a girl dreams of a
reptile, let her look sharp that her lover don’t play her false. 34, 3.

rescue. if you dream of rescuing anyone from peril, it is a sign you
will rise in the world, either by means of increased wealth, or new
honors: to dream that you are rescued from drowning or from any other
mode of death, shows that you will go into some successful business
speculation with a partner. to lovers, such a dream foretells a speedy
and happy union. 64, 9.

resign. if a person who holds an office, or a trust of any kind,
dreams of resigning, it is a sign of advancement: to any one who cannot
be advanced, it shows that he will rise above his present position in
society. 41, 17.

resuscitate. to dream of resuscitating a drowned person, foretells that
you will engage in some enterprise that attracts public attention: if
the person thus brought to life is a female, it shadows forth marriage
with a lady of public fame. 16, 9, 78.

revenge. to dream of revenging an injury, is a sign of disgrace: if, in
your dream, you imagine that you have caused any one to be locked up in
prison from motives of revenge, it predicts that you yourself will be
imprisoned for some degrading act. 74, 50.

revival. to dream of a religious revival, or of being where a great
many people are holding a revival meeting, is a sign that you will go
into a disreputable public place and lose _caste_: if you take part in
the meeting, it foretells that you will come to disgrace, as all such
dreams work contrariwise. 13, 57.

reward. to dream of receiving a reward for any act which is a public
benefit, such as detecting a criminal, is a sign that you will have
honors conferred upon you: if you dream of getting a reward for finding
money or other property, it foreshadows good fortune and riches. 41.

rheumatism. to dream of this painful disease, is an omen of health:
if you imagine a friend is thus afflicted, it shows that he will soon
offer to do you a favor, or benefit you in some way. 52, 16.

rhinoceros. to dream of this east india animal, denotes success to the
man of business, but disappointment in love matters; but to dream they
injure you, is unfavorable to the dreamer. if you dream you see one
dead, you’ll soon leave a relative. 47.

ribbons. for a girl to dream that she has got new, and beautiful
ribbons on her bonnet or dress, is a sign some one will flatter her to
her disadvantage: if she does not like the ribbon, it shows that she
will hear of some scandal relative to herself; and if the ribbon is
red, the scandal will impeach her chastity. 39, 6.

rice. to dream of eating rice, denotes health: if you imagine that you
see large quantities of rice, it foretells to one who does not live in
a rice country, a successful and pleasant journey; and to those who
live there, it predicts gain and riches. 12, 2, 24.

rich. to dream you are rich or that you have inherited a fortune, is
a sign of poverty and bad luck; but if you imagine that some one pays
you large sums of money enough to make you rich, your dream will be
realized so far that you will acquire property. if a person dreams that
a legacy is paid to him in money, it has an entirely different meaning
from a dream that you are enriched from a legacy, but do not see the
money. 15, 3.

riding. (_see carriage, stage-coach, and gig._) to dream you are
riding, if it be with a woman, is unfortunate: in trade, decay of
business; in love, disappointments; but if it be with men, then, by
care, the reverse of these things will happen. riding in a railcar, or
a stage, foretells success in business matters. 6, 12, 72.

ring. for a lady to dream that a gentleman presents her with a ring, or
that she has a ring belonging to a gentleman, is a sign of a wedding.
if a young man dreams that he has got a lady’s ring, the omen is
similar. to dream of finding a ring, foretells that the person finding
it will marry within a year. 4, 20.

riot. to dream of a public tumult or riot, is a sign of scarcity and
bad crops to farmers, and dull business to tradesmen and mechanics:
if any friend or relative is injured in the riot, you or they will
probably suffer from misfortune, but if they are successful and pacify
the crowd, it foretells that you will overcome your difficulties. 2.

rival. for a lover to dream that he has a rival who annoys him, is a
sign that he is in high favor with his sweetheart; such a dream to a
young lady has a similar omen, and she has only to name the happy day
to settle the matter to her mind. 1, 70.

river. to dream of crossing a large and clear river, foretells
a splendid fortune: if the water is muddy or riled, it predicts
difficulties, but they will be overcome provided you get safe over the
river without accident. if a girl dreams this, it is a sign she will
travel somewhere and get a rich husband. 34, 20.

robbery. (_see thief and stealing._)

robin. to dream of seeing robins around your house, is a good omen, as
it foretells abundance to farmers and success to any one; if you do not
see them, but hear them trilling, it foreshadows sickness, and perhaps
death. 6.

rocket. to dream of seeing rockets flying in the air, foretells joy and
gladness at some event about to happen: to married people it denotes
the birth of a child, or the marriage of a daughter if they have one

rocks. (_see mountain._)

rooster. (_see cock._) if a girl dreams of hearing a cock crow, it
foretells that she will soon have a new lover; if a lover dreams this,
it is a sign that he has a formidable rival: if a married man or woman
dreams of roosters, it shows that some outsider is enamored of the
wife. 10, 19.

rose. to dream of roses is a sign of troubles: the old saying that
every rose has its thorn, is exemplified in such a dream, because every
rose you see brings along a trouble: dreaming of white roses signifies
a marriage which will bring much vexation. 47, 9.

rosemary. to the married, denotes loss of their mates and children; to
the lover, trouble through his or her sweetheart. 49, 7.

rotten. to dream of rotten things of any kind (except eggs), foretells
sickness and death: to imagine that you handle rotten eggs, foreshadows
disgrace. 35.

rowing. to dream of rowing a boat in clear water, is a sign of

difficulties which  be overcome; if a lover dreams of rowing a boat
with his lady-love in it, he will doubtless make a happy match, 20.

are sailing, foretells that one of the persons who you imagine are in

ruin. if you dream that you are looking at old ruins, or castles, or
buildings, it is a sign you will travel in distant countries: to dream

will experience a loss of property: if, in your dream, you see the
ruins of a house that has fallen down, it denotes the death of a friend
or acquaintance. 5, 12, 60.

run. (_see race._) to dream of running swift, is a sign of good success
in your undertakings; but if you stumble or fall, it denotes accidents
or misfortune: if you imagine that you see people run, while you are
still, it foretells disappointment. 7.

rust. to dream of rust is a bad omen: rusty knives, or tools of any
kind, denote the destruction of property: rusty pails or utensils are
so many signs of poverty. 54.

matters; it also foretells success in love affairs: to the married it
foreshadows domestic happiness. 69.

of the herb, is a sign of health and wealth: if the flowers that you
gather look clear and healthy, it foretells that you will get just so
much gold. 19, 24.

sailing. to dream of fair sailing on clear water, is an excellent omen,
as it foretells abundance and success: heavy winds that endanger your

overcome. (_see boat, yacht and ship._) 20.

sausages. to dream of eating fried sausages, foretells that you
will come in contact with some person who is very poor, and will be
disagreeable to you: a girl who dreams this, will be very sure to get a
shiftless and needy lover, and perhaps marry him if she is in much of a
hurry to get married. 38, 16.

sawing. to dream of sawing wood, or boards, foretells that you will do
something that you will afterwards regret: if a young fellow dreams
this, he will probably offer some indignity to his sweetheart, which he
will find it hard work to get overlooked. 3, 17, 55.

scaffold. to dream of going upon a high scaffold, shows that you will
rise in the world: if, in your dream, you imagine that you fall from a
scaffold, or from any high place, it shadows forth a misfortune that
will make you poorer: a girl who dreams of climbing upon a scaffold,
will positively marry a rich man, or one of distinction, who is far
above her in position. 33, 7.

scalded. to dream of being scalded with hot water, is usually a sign of
injuries by the elements; it  foretell losses by floods, by fire, or
by winds, or by thunder-storms: if you dream of scalding your tongue
with hot tea, it is a sign that you will scandalize a neighbor with
some ill-natured remark. 3, 12, 36.

scales. to dream you are weighing any article, is a good omen, and

another using the scales, is a sign you will be ruined by law-suits.
68, 40.

scarcity. to dream of a scarcity of anything is a sign that some of
the article dreamed about is on its way to you; as if a farmer were to
dream of a scarcity of hay, it shows that his next hay crop will be
very abundant; or, if a girl should dream of a scarcity of compliments,
she will probably be overwhelmed by them from gentlemen, when she next
goes into company. 27, 9.

school. to dream of attending school, is a sign of advancement and good
fortune: if you dream of studying, and succeed well, it shadows forth
that you will rise to a position in society above your present one: if
you find it difficult to learn, you will have trouble in getting along,
but will rise at last. 42, 72.

scissors. to dream of a pair of scissors, is a sign of a marriage; if
a girl dreams of them she will positively be married within a year:
to a married woman such a dream is a bad omen, as it denotes some gay
seducer will flatter her, and probably succeed in enticing her from the
path of virtue. here is an old prediction in rhyme: 47.

  to dream of scissors—a full pair,
    tells a fair maid that soon she’ll marry;
  but to a wife it doth declare
    her chastity will e’en miscarry!

scold. for a man to dream he has a scolding, shrewish wife, is a sign

that his sweetheart scolds at him, it is a sign that her love is strong
and unalterable. 65, 16.

scratch. to dream of having your face scratched, is a sign that
somebody has been disparaging your good looks: if a girl imagines in
her dream that she has scratched herself with a pin, it foretells that
scandal is afloat relative to her conduct with her lover, or some other
gentleman. 3.

in all you undertake; but to dream of a large bed-screw portends
trouble brought about by love affairs. 4, 11, 44.

scythe. (_see husbandry._)

sea. to dream of going to sea in a ship or steamer, is a sign that you
will be fortunate in money matters: storms and perils at sea foretell
difficulties which  be overcome: if you dream you are seasick, it
denotes continued health. if a girl dreams of going to sea, and having
a pleasant voyage, she will marry rich, and love her husband; but
storms and perils point to quarrels with him. 6.

secret. if a young girl dreams that a friend has intrusted her with an
important secret, it is a sign that the friend will become her enemy:
if her lover tells her a secret, they will surely quarrel within a
week; if she dreams of disclosing a secret to a friend, she will be
much vexed at some scandal that is afloat respecting her. 4, 2, 8.

seducer. if a young woman dreams that her lover’s conduct is that of a
gay seducer, she will find him to be very sincere in his attachment:
a married woman who dreams that she is over-persuaded by a seducer
to yield to his desires, will come to much honor, as such dreams
work contrariwise. if a man dreams of seducing a virtuous girl, it
foreshadows that he will be disgraced. 35, 8.

segar. (_see tobacco._) to dream you are smoking a segar, is a sign you
will have misfortunes and troubles with your business matters: if you
imagine the fire of your segar goes out, it is a sign you will meet
with losses: in love matters this dream is a bad omen. 49, 7, 9.

separation. if a woman dreams that she is about to live separate from
her husband, it promises that she will shortly find herself in the
family way: such a dream to a man is a sign that some woman or girl,
other than his wife, is in love with him. 26, 17.

servants. (_see domestics._) to dream that you are robbed by your
servants, is a sign that some one among them that you think the most
of is deceiving you: if, in your dream, you imagine you have had your
silver stolen by a servant, it shows that you will have a difficulty,
and discharge one who will be replaced by a dishonest person. 71, 40,
11.

shark. to dream of seeing a shark in the water, is an excellent omen,
as it foretells that you will escape a great danger that menaces you:
if you dream of capturing the shark, you will soon thereafter get a big
lump of money. catching fish of any kind foretells money-getting. 31.

shave. for a man to dream that he is shaving, is a sign he will get in
debt: to dream that any one shaved you in a bargain, foretells that
some debt will be paid to you which you had given up as lost. 5, 7, 54.

shawl. if a girl dreams of getting a new shawl, it foretells that she
will soon have a new beau who will be very attentive and affable. 3, 19.

sheep. to dream of large flocks of sheep, is a sign of thrift and
abundance, particularly to farmers, to whom the omen promises large
crops: if many of the sheep have young lambs, it foretells domestic
happiness and an excellent crop of children. 12, 5, 60.

shell. (_see oysters and clams._) to dream you find an empty shell is a
sign you will meet with losses in business, but if, in your dream, you
imagine the shell to be full, it foretells you will be successful in
all your undertakings. if you dream you are opening any kind of shell
fish for others to eat it foreshadows that you will have plenty of
funds. 19, 53.

sheriff. if you dream the sheriff is after you with a writ, or a
warrant, and that you dodge and escape him, it is a sign of bad luck
and losses; but if he arrests and locks you up in prison, it foretells
that some good fortune is coming. soon after such a dream you will be
lucky in anything you undertake. 62, 21.

shift. (_see linen and smock._)

ship. to dream of seeing a ship under full sail, while you stand on the
shore, is a sign you will soon fall in love with a pretty girl, who
will favor your addresses; but if you see this ship while you are on
the water in some other vessel, it shows that your sweetheart will be
jealous of you. to dream of being shipwrecked and losing your property,
foretells good luck in business matters, but quarrels in love affairs.
29, 8.

shirt. to dream that your shirt is ragged and without buttons, is
a sign of poverty: if you imagine that you have a new shirt, with
a stylish bosom, it foretells some disagreeable adventure in which
your self-esteem will be keenly wounded, such as being placed in a
ridiculous position before ladies, or before company in public. 44, 18.

shoes. (_see boots._) if you dream that one of your shoes has a hole
in it, it foretells that your sweetheart will offend you by favoring
a supposed rival: if a girl dreams this, her lover will be jealous
of her: for a young man to dream that he has lost a shoe-string, is
a sign that he will be kissed by a lady with whom he had no previous
acquaintance. 33.

shroud. (_see corpse._) to dream of a shroud is a sign of a wedding:
to see, in your dream, a woman laid out in her shroud, foretells to a
young person that he or she will either be present at a marriage, or
will become a victim of cupid’s archery. 39, 11.

sickness. (_see disease._) if you dream you have had a long sickness,
and are recovering, it foretells bad luck and difficulties: should
you imagine that you are sick and are going to die, the omen is the
reverse, for some good fortune awaits you: if a girl dreams that she is
sick abed, and her lover visits her, it foretells a smooth courtship
and happy marriage. 2.

silks. for a lady to dream of silks and satins, and that she is having
fine dresses made of those fabrics, foretells poverty and want: if she
imagines that she is presented with a plain cheap dress, and is pleased
with the present, it is a sign she will have some excellent luck; but
if she dislikes it, it shows that she will refuse an offer that will
cause her after regrets. 8, 7, 56.

silver. (_see metals._)

singing. to dream of singing solemn music in a choir, is a sign of
the death of a young girl who is your esteemed friend or relative: to
lovers, such a dream foretells the loss of sweethearts: if you imagine
you are singing some lively tune by yourself, it is a sign of sorrow,
though it  not be connected with any death. 34, 18.

single. if a married woman dreams that she is single, and that
attentions are being paid to her by a beau, it foretells that her
husband has become captivated by a new love, and will probably be false
to his vows: the omen is similar to a married man who dreams that he is
either a bachelor or widower. 69, 72.

sister. (_see brothers._) to dream you see your sister denotes a speedy
death in your family, and that the dreamer will be long-lived: if you
are in love, it is a favorable omen. 24, 8.

skating. to dream of skating over smooth ice, and gliding along without
much effort, is a sign of success and good luck: if you are skating
with ladies, it foretells that your love matters will go smoothly; if
the ice be broken or lumpy, it denotes difficulties; and if you imagine
you fall down, you will probably experience a misfortune or have great
trouble. 4, 7, 28.

sky. a clear sky denotes a marriage, speedy, and happy; a red sky,
increase of wealth; if you ascend into the sky, you  look for much
honor; a cloudy sky shows misfortune. 2, 11, 24.

slaughter-house. to dream of being in an empty slaughter-house, shows
that you are in danger, but can avoid it by precaution. to see animals
slaughtered is a good sign, if the blood flow freely; if the blood does
not flow, you will meet with some accident. 26, 12.

slave. to dream that a favorite slave has become ungrateful, and run
away, is a sign that some one has been tampering with him or her,
but without effect; if, in your dream, you imagine that one of your
favorite negroes has been impertinent or neglectful, and is to be
flogged, and that you feel bad about it, it shows that some one will
try to injure you through the medium of your slaves, and you should
therefore look sharp to the characters of white people around. 62, 4.

sleigh-ride. to dream of a sleigh-ride, where the sleighing is good,
and the sleigh glides free and noiseless, is an excellent omen, as it
foretells success and good fortune generally, particularly to farmers:
but if you imagine the sleighing is poor, and that the runners screech
on the ground, it foretells trouble and unhappiness. young men who
dream of sleigh-riding with girls, stopping at taverns, drinking,
getting the girls boozy, and then performing unnamable pranks, are thus
forewarned that they will be poor and shiftless, as such dreams are
certain omens of misery and disgrace. 67, 46.

sliding. (_see ice._) to dream of sliding on smooth ice, foretells good
luck: if a girl dreams that a young man assists her in sliding, and
that she enjoys it, she will soon get an agreeable lover: ragged or wet
ice, or holes in the ice, foreshadow difficulties. if a girl dreams
of falling down on the ice, and that her lover falls with her, and
overtops her, they  as well go to the parson at once, and have the
knot tied, as it is a sure thing to happen. 4, 28.

small-pox. (_see sores._) to dream that you have this disease,
foretells health and good fortune: if a lover should be so ungallant,
as to imagine that his sweetheart is thus afflicted, it is a sign that
he will marry a great beauty; if she happens to be a beauty, it will be
all right, of course; if not, he will look out for number two. 41, 32.

smock. (_see linen._) if a girl dreams that she has a ragged
undergarment, it foretells that some rich greenhorn will try to seduce
her, and failing, will offer her marriage: if she dreams that she has
a good supply of beautiful worked undergarments, it is a sign that she
will sigh in vain for a lover; if she imagines that a gentleman gives
her a new smock, she will be in danger of losing her chastity. 12.

smoke. to dream of being in a room full of smoke, foretells that you
will engage in an angry controversy, and perhaps quarrel: lovers who
dream of smoke, will nose out the fire when they next meet, and it will
prove to be either one of anger or of lust. 76, 5.

snake. to dream of snakes is a sign of an enemy, or that some one is
slandering you; it also denotes quarrels and angry disputes: if an
engaged young lady dreams of them, she had better ascertain positively
whether her lover is all right before she marries him. 47, 50.

sneeze. to dream you sneeze, is a sign of long life. 55.

snow. (_see sleigh-ride and thaw._) to dream that the ground is covered
with clean, white snow, is a sign of joy and pleasure: if you walk in
it, it foretells that you will go on a pleasant journey; to eat it,
denotes health: if the snow is dirty, or melted in patches, you will
have troubles, but they will not amount to much. to dream of a regular
storm, is a sign you will be very successful in all your love and
business affairs. 21, 67, 46.

snuff. (_see tobacco._)

snuffers. (_see candles._) to dream of snuffing out a candle, is a sign
of a death in the family: if you imagine that you snuff it too short,
without putting it out, it foretells that you will do something that
will make a female friend shed tears. 40.

soap. signifies trouble in business, but it will soon depart. 66, 3, 11.

soldier’s drum. (_see zouave, parade and procession._)

sores. to dream of your body being covered with blotches, shows that a
great fortune will fall to you. to have the arms full of sores, shows
ill success in business. 19, 74.

sow. to dream of a sow with a large litter of pigs, denotes abundance
to a farmer, but is a sign of ill-health to a tradesman or mechanic: if
a girl dreams this, it foretells that she will soon marry a man in bad
health. 4, 12, 48.

spider. to dream that you see a spider coming toward you, is a sign
that some one will soon pay you money: if you imagine that the spider
spins down before your face, the omen is similar, for you will make a
good lot of money in some way. if a married woman dreams of seeing a
large spider, it foretells that she will have a miscarriage, which she
will not be sorry for. 72, 16.

spy-glass. to dream of looking through one of these instruments and
observing objects at a distance, is a sign that you will enlarge your
possessions; if you are a farmer, you will add to your farm; if a man
of business, enlarge your business, &c.; but to a poor devil who hasn’t
got much of anything, it predicts that he will increase his family for
the want of something else to enlarge. 14.

squinting. (_see eye._) if a girl dreams of seeing a good-looking young
man who squints, it is a sign that some one has fallen in love with
her, and only waits an opportunity to demonstrate his passion: if a
gentleman dreams that his sweetheart squints, it foretells that she is
thinking about some one else rather than him, and would not break her
heart if he refused to  “come to tea.” 49.

squirrel. to dream of these animals is a sign of good fortune; they
denote abundant crops to a farmer, and success to any one: if a man
dreams of being bitten by a squirrel, it foretells that he will lose
something by robbery; if he catches the animal when it bites him, and
puts it in a cage, the omen is different, for he will have a piece of
good luck—though a robbery  be mixed up in it. 21.

stable. to dream of a stable denotes hospitality and good
entertainment. 2, 11.

stage-coach. to dream of riding in one signifies good luck in business:
if you run after one, you will be out of employment for a long season:
to see one pass, will rid you of troublesome friends. if you are in a
stage-coach and it turns over without injuring you, you will be lucky
in your speculations; if you dream you are killed by the fall, you must
expect misfortune. (_see riding and coach._) 6, 12, 72.

stain. for a girl to dream of stains on her dress, is a sign of
scandal: if she imagines that the stains are in front, she will be
accused of an improper intimacy with a gentleman; if on the right
sleeve, it will be insinuated that she took what did not belong to her;
if on the left sleeve, some one will be disparaging her veracity. if a
lover dreams that his sweetheart’s dress is stained behind, it shows
that she is untrue to him. 65, 13.

stars. (_see night._) to dream of seeing multitudes of bright stars
in a clear sky, is a sign (to a lady) that she will have a great many
children, and troops of good friends: to a man of business, such a
dream denotes as many customers as he sees stars in a clear sky. if a
girl dreams of seeing stars, and notices one or more to be brighter
than the rest, those bright ones are lovers, and the small ones are her
children or friends. 4, 19.

statue. to dream of marble statues is a sign of advancement; those who
imagine that they see beautiful statuary will be sure to rise above
their present position in society. 3, 13.

stealing. (_see thief._) if you dream of being robbed, it is a sign
that you will make a good speculation of some kind; to dream of
stealing any particular article yourself, foretells that you will soon
want just that thing; thus, if you imagine that you steal money, you
will be badly in want of some. 49, 16.

steel. (_see metals._)

steeple. (_see tower._) to dream of going up to the top of a steeple,
and looking off at a distance, is a sign that you will increase your
property or effects: if a girl dreams this, it foretells that she will
marry above her present position. 6.

stick. to hold a stick foretells mourning; to use it as a prop,
instability of fortune; to any one with it shows that you are
charitable; to receive a beating with one, predicts you will better
your position in life. 7, 7[tn: illegible].

stillborn. if a woman dreams that she gives birth to a stillborn child,
it foretells that her next child will be an uncommon bright one: a
childless woman who dreams this, will realize her fondest hopes. 49, 77.

by unjust and scandalous reports: a young lady who dreams that a bee
stings her, will probably have her chastity questioned. 64, 18.

of silk, poverty. to take them off, denotes the reception of money.
stockings with holes in them, signify the loss of property. 47, 71.

storm. (_see rain, hail and snow._) to dream of a devastating storm,
foretells losses and trouble: a violent rain-storm denotes that you
will have good luck, but that misfortunes will nevertheless injure your
prospects: gentle showers promise the luck without the adverse omen.
21, 72.

stove. to dream of a stove is a sign of wealth, if there be a fire in
it; but if cold, a sign of poverty. 8, 60.

stranger. for a girl to dream that she is kissed by a stranger,
promises her a new lover: a married woman who dreams this will probably
soon present her husband with a stranger in the shape of a new baby,
and he will unhappily doubt its paternity. 62, 8.

straw. to dream of a bundle of straw denotes abundance; if scattered
about, poverty. 4, 51, 78.

strawberries. to dream of this fruit, denotes success in love affairs,
and a happy marriage. 39, 78.

suckle. (_see wet-nurse._) if a married woman dreams of suckling a
child, it foretells that she will soon give birth to another; should
a bachelor dream of seeing a child suckled, he had better make up his
mind that he will soon have a young lady’s board to pay, whether he
marries or not; but as the latter would be the better course let him be
looking round for a wife at once. a married man who dreams this, will
soon become a happy father. 7, 9, 63.

sugar. to dream of sugar denotes purity: if a lover dreams that his
sweetheart presents him with white loaf-sugar, it shows that her
affection for him is pure and disinterested; it is therefore a good
sign for him to dream of taking tea with her, as she would naturally
put such sugar in his tea: to dream of sugar of any kind, or sugar
candy, is an excellent omen. 19, 48.

an old prediction runs as follows:

  dreams of sugar and sweetmeat,
  or drinking wine with pleasure great,
  and all dreams pleasant in condition,
  show sports of love, and love’s fruition.

sun. to dream that the sun blinds you, foretells that you will be
overwhelmed with good fortune: to see a beautiful bright sun, is a sign
of success in anything you  undertake: a red sun denotes mishaps
and accidents: if the sun looks dim and smoky, it foreshadows trouble
and difficulties. to dream of seeing the sun rise brings good news and
luck; the setting sun, misfortune. 2, 10, 20.

swallows. to dream of these birds, is a good omen, as it foretells
health and abundant crops to farmers: if you dream of killing a
swallow, it is a sign of a misfortune; if you catch the bird, you will
have splendid luck and get plenty of money; but if, after capturing,
you dream you let him go, a fortune will slip through your fingers. 25.

sorrow. its song denotes death. 9, 18.

and swears, it foretells that he will come to poverty. 72, 4.

sweeping. for a girl to dream of sweeping the house, foretells that a
lover will soon make his appearance: if a married woman dreams this, it
shows that some outsider is charmed with her, and  venture to make
dishonorable proposals. 39, 12.

success and good fortune generally: if you dream you are swimming, or

marry the one of your choice, particularly if she be present; and to
dream you are naked and swimming in clear water, is a sign of excellent
luck in business matters. 54, 18.

sword. to dream of having a sword, is a sign of poverty: if you dream
of seeing a man flourish one of these weapons, it foretells you will
make a loss. a young girl who imagines her lover wears a sword, had
better give up all ideas of silks and satins, and learn how to cook and
wash, for she will be a poor man’s wife. 17.

table-cloth. to dream of a dirty table-cloth foretells that you will
have plenty to eat. 51.

tailor. if a girl dreams that she has a tailor for her beau, and is
pleased with him, it is a sign that she will marry a softly sort of
a fellow, who will allow her to be both master and mistress after
marriage. here is a popular rhyme in illustration: 19, 70.

  the maid who dreams a tailor she would wed,
    will marry one who’ll be a log in bed;
  and she’ll be master, too, of all his riches,
    and, in the vulgar parlance,  “wear the breeches!”

sign that her future husband will be a  “wee bit of a fellow,” and not
of much account. 4.

will in some foreign country. 12, 6, 72.

tavern. (_see inn._)

tea. to dream of drinking tea, or being present at a tea-party, is a
sign of thrift and domestic happiness: a girl who dreams of meeting her

he’s all right, and she can close her matrimonial bargain with him at
once without any risk. 61, 19.

is in love with you; this applies to both sexes, but more particularly
to girls who cry easy: if you imagine you cry from grief, some good

shed: if you dream that you shed tears from vexation, it shows that you
will experience a loss just in proportion to the tears, or that some
one will injure your prospects by circulating a scandal. 14.

at a distance over farm lands, is a sign you will either purchase a
farm or inherit one: if you dream of looking at the stars, it shows
that you will rise in the world—if at the moon, and you are delighted
with the view, it predicts for you great riches. 7, 14.

tempest. (_see storm._) to dream of long-continuing and great tempests,
signifies affliction, troubles, dangers, losses and perils; to the
poor, repose. 57, 8.

ten-pins. to dream of playing ten-pins, foretells disgrace; if the
centre pin falls, one of the players will die; if many pins fall, all
of the players will suffer loss. 10, 2, 20.

thaw. to dream of a thaw, and walking in splashy snow, foretells
trouble and losses: if a young fellow dreams that he walks through
splashy snow to go a courting, it is a sign that he will quarrel with
his sweetheart. 34, 18.

theatre. for a young man to dream of taking his sweetheart to the
theatre, is a sign that she will favor a new beau: if he dreams
of going to the theatre alone, and seeing his lady-love among the
audience, it shows that she has already seen and spoken to a gentleman
that she likes better than him: if a lady dreams this of her beau, the
omen is similar. 2, 4, 8.

thief. (_see stealing._) to dream that thieves break into your house
and rob you, is a sign of honor or profit—the greater the robbery, the
more extensive will be your good fortune: if you dream that you catch a
thief and deliver him over to the officers of justice, it denotes that
you will have trouble in connection with your good fortune. 49, 16, 3.

thirst. if any one dream of thirst or of drinking water, if the water
appear clear and acceptable, he will live joyfully and become wealthy;
if the water be troubled, warm, or offensive, it forewarns him that
without prudence, he will end his days in affliction. 20, 49.

thorn. for a girl to dream of accidentally sticking a thorn into her
finger is a sign she will have a ring presented to her, probably a
wedding ring: if a married woman dreams this, some outsider will make
love to her by first offering a ring. if any one dreams of sticking a
thorn in either foot or leg, it foretells improper intimacy with the
opposite sex which will not end in disgrace, but in marriage: married
people who dream this will do the same thing and not be found out. 39.

throat. for a married woman to dream that her throat is sore, or
swelled, or out of order, is a sign she is in the family way; and a
girl who dreams this had better be careful and keep pretty clear of the
young fellows, for fear of accidents. 60, 18.

thumb. if a girl dreams that her beau hurts her by pinching her thumb,
it is a sign that if she marries him she will have to get her own
living, and help to support him besides: for a man to dream of losing
his thumb, or of an injury to it, foretells poverty—on the contrary, to
dream of a big thumb denotes much wealth. 36, 5.

thunder. to dream of heavy thunder denotes large crops to farmers: to
tradesmen, mechanics, or speculators, it foretells a big business, or
a successful speculation: if you are terrified by thunder, so much the
better. 51.

tiger. to dream of seeing one of these animals in a rage, is a sign
that you have a treacherous friend who will endanger your reputation:
to see, in your dream, a sleeping or quiet tiger, foretells that you
will soon make the acquaintance of a treacherous or unworthy person. if
a girl dreams this, she had better be suspicious of the next young man
who offers her his attentions. 59, 62.

toad. to dream of seeing a toad is a sign of a rain storm: if, in your
dream, you see multitudes of small toads, it foretells good crops to
farmers, and excellent luck to anybody: if a newly married woman dreams
this, it shadows forth that she will have as many smart children as
she sees toads—three or four at a time, perhaps—and if she don’t, her
husband will beget them elsewhere. 3.

tobacco. for a boy to dream of chewing tobacco, is a sign of poverty,
as rum and tobacco-chewing go together: to dream of smoking foretells
waste, but is not exactly an omen of poverty, though waste always
precedes that state. the best way is not to dream of using tobacco at
all. if you dream of seeing large piles of tobacco, it is a sign of bad
luck and loss in some speculation. to dream you take snuff is a bad
omen in love affairs, but if you dream you sneeze when you take it, it
is a sign of long life. 49, 7, 55.

tomatoes. to dream of this valuable vegetable, denotes prosperity in
life; if you have children, they will thrive; if you are in love, your
suit will be successful. if a maiden dreams of them, it denotes that
she will marry her present sweetheart, have many children, and be very
happy; to a farmer it denotes abundant crops. 78, 6.

tomb. to dream of visiting a large and magnificent tomb-stone
foreshadows that you will fall in love with some one above you in
social position: visiting a cemetery or grave-yard in your dream, is a
sign that your turn will soon come to join the matrimonial ranks. 48.

tongue. if a lady dreams of having a sore on her tongue, it is a sign
that she has uttered a slander. 54.

tooth-ache. to dream that you have the tooth-ache is a sign of trouble:
if you imagine that you are about to have the tooth pulled, it
foretells that your trouble will end by a piece of good luck; and if
you dream that the tooth is out, and you have it in your hand, you will
soon gain a good lump of money. 8, 5, 34.

torch. to see a bright torch-light at a distance in a dark night, and
go toward it, foretells a successful journey; but if you stumble by the
way you will experience an accident: to dream of carrying a lighted
torch at night, is a sign that some distant friend will pay you a
visit. 20.

tower. (_see steeple._) to dream of going upon a high tower, and
looking off on a beautiful landscape, foretells that you will acquire
land either by purchase or inheritance: if you look off upon the water,
it is a sign of a journey by sea, during which you will acquire riches:
if birds are flying around the tower, they foretell so many troubles.
58.

trap. to dream of setting a trap to catch rats or mice, is a sign, to a
girl, that she will receive the attentions of a dishonest lover: if she
dreams of catching any, she will probably marry a great scamp, or be
seduced by one. 6.

traveling. to dream of traveling by railroad or steamboat is a very
good omen, as it denotes thrift and success in your business; but if
you dream you are journeying in your own private coach, it foreshadows
poverty in the end, though you  have temporary good luck: if you
dream you have crossed the ocean, and find yourself in a foreign
country, you  be sure that good fortune will attend all your
business transactions. 6, 11, 66.

trees. (_see blossom._) to dream of green and flourishing trees is an
excellent omen, as it foretells riches—the larger the trees, the better
the fortune: if you dream of climbing into a high tree, you will not
only be rich, but will come to great distinction. if a girl should
dream of seeing her lover up a tree, she will marry a wealthy and
distinguished man. 4.

tripe. if a woman dreams of cleaning tripe, it foretells that she will
either be untrue to her husband or an outrage will be perpetrated upon
her: to dream of eating tripe is about as bad, for it shows to a man
that he will be engaged in some affair with a female (not his wife)
which will bring him to disgrace. 28, 9.

triplets. if a woman dreams that she gives birth to three children at
one parturition, it foretells riches and honors: if a husband dreams
that his wife is so delivered, the omen is the same: if any one dreams
of seeing triplets who are healthy and well-formed, it foretells good
luck and success, particularly in love matters. 46, 5.

trout. to dream of catching trout is an excellent omen, as it foretells
that you will get money—the larger the trout, the more cash you will
receive. it is stated in some of the books that to newly married people
such a dream foretells the birth of a child, but i have been unable
to verify this, because most young married people will have children
whether they dream of trout or not. 29, 5.

trumpet. to dream you hear the sound of a trumpet, is a bad omen, and
denotes trouble and misfortune; to the tradesman it presages the loss
of business; to the farmer, bad crops; to the lover, insincerity in the
object of your affections. 46, 9.

trunk. to dream of a full trunk, shows the necessity of economy; an
empty one, signifies that you  expect to receive money. 39, 62, 1.

tub. to dream of a tub is a bad omen: if it be filled with water, you
have evil to fear; an empty tub signifies trouble; and to run against
one, sorrow. 46, 9.

tulips. to dream of these beautiful flowers is a sign of abundance: if
you imagine you see a garden full of them belonging to yourself, it
foretells that you will become rich and distinguished: if a girl dreams
that her lover presents her with tulips, she will undoubtedly marry
well, and probably her husband will be wealthy. 48.

turkey. to dream of seeing a flock of turkeys denotes to a tradesman,
or a farmer, that he will have a transaction which will bring him in a
considerable sum in ready money: if a lover who is about to be married
dreams of turkeys, he will find that his sweetheart has got a marriage
portion in ready money. 72, 15.

turnip. to dream of turnips signifies the discovery of secrets and
domestic quarrels. 29, 52.

turtle. to dream of turtles is a sign of long life: an engaged young
lady who dreams of these animals will probably marry according to her
wishes, and live with her husband until they become an old couple; but
her husband will be one of the slow and easy kind. 67, 49, 5.

twins. to dream of having twins, brings good news, and is a sign of
honor or riches; it is also a good omen in love matters if a man dreams
it, but if a girl has this dream she must look out for the boys. 44, 4.

umbrella. if a young girl dreams that she has got a new umbrella, it
foretells a new lover: if a married woman dreams this, it is a sign
that some other gentleman besides her husband is enamored of her. a
man who dreams of buying an umbrella will have a narrow escape from
threatened danger. 70, 30, 1.

under ground. to dream that you go down under ground, whether into a
well, a deep cellar or vault, or a cave, denotes your early death; but
if you dream that you are digging in the ground, and are in a hole
which you have dug, the omen is different, for it denotes riches and
long life. 5, 9, 45.

undress. to see your wife undress, signifies wantonness; to undress in
the presence of others, slander; to undress in your room alone, the
discovery of secrets. 48, 3.

vaccinated. to dream of being vaccinated foretells good health; and if
you imagine that you have a large sore on your arm from vaccination, it
is a sign that you will present to some one a liberal gift, and receive
much honor. 49.

varnishing. to dream that your house or furniture is being, or has
been, newly varnished, is a sign of a funeral; but if you imagine that
you are varnishing anything, it merely foretells a loss with out a
death. 59, 76.

vault. an unexpected estate will fall to you, if you dream of a vault.
21, 18.

veal. to dream of veal being roasted is good; but boiled, shows
sickness; and raw, a great disappointment; particularly to those who
have recently formed an attachment or any new connection. 48, 2.

velvet. if a lady dreams of new velvet dresses, it foretells poverty:
velvet cushions, slippers or bonnets, are signs of waste and want. 36,
18.

venison. to dream of eating venison is a sign that you will travel: if
you imagine you see large saddles of venison in market, it foretells a
journey for business purposes which will be profitable. 42, 70.

vermin. to dream of any kind of vermin, is ominous of ill-luck and
enemies, especially if they are in the house, or near the fireplace;
but if out of the house, they are unimportant. 27, 62.

vexation. to dream of being much vexed, foretells the reverse, and that
you will shortly be much pleased. 33, 61.

vinegar. to dream you drink vinegar, signifies sickness and sharp
words: to use it in pickling, is a sign of gain. 29, 6, 76.

vines. to dream of seeing or pruning grape-vines, or gathering grapes,
is prosperity to persons in trade, journeys to the rich, employment to
the poor, and comfort to those in affliction. 38, 17.

violin. (_see fiddle._)

virgin. if a man dreams that he defloured a virgin, it is a sign that
he will be disgraced by some act of his own: to dream of seeing the
virgin mary, foretells that great honors await you: such a dream, to an
honest business man, promises him riches and honor; but to a dishonest
one, it foretells disaster. 54, 3.

vomiting. to dream of vomiting is usually a sign of health: if you
imagine that you vomit up worms, it foretells that you will have good
luck in preventing a loss, or a robbery. 14, 65.

vote. to dream you are voting, is bad, particularly to a sick person:
for a newly married woman to dream of voting, is a sure sign that her
first child will be a boy, who will come to great honors. 9.

vow. to dream that you have made a vow and broken it, is bad to all.
21, 78.

vulture. to dream of the vulture is unfortunate to all, except sick
persons, to whom it foretells a speedy recovery. 41, 62.

wading. if a girl dreams of wading in clear water, it is a sign that
she will soon marry, and be delighted with her husband’s embraces: if
she imagines that the water is rily or muddy, it foretells that she
will enjoy the pleasures of illicit love. if a man dreams of wading,
it denotes that he will be engaged in some intrigue with a female—the
deeper the water, the more difficult the realization of his wishes:
muddy water denotes loose women. 20, 16.

wake. to dream of going to a wake where drinking and howling is
going on, is a sign of poverty and misery: if a girl dreams this, it
foretells her speedy marriage with a man who will turn out to be a
miserable drunkard. if a young man dreams of seeing his sweetheart at a
wake, he had better back out from the bargain, as she will never be of
much account, and  become a drunkard. 8.

walking. to dream you are walking in a dirty and muddy place,
foretells sickness and vexation: in love, it denotes bad temper and
disappointment. 47.

walls. to dream you are walking on, or climbing over walls, denotes
some dangerous enterprise, trouble, and vexation: if you get down
without the wall falling, or hurting yourself, you will succeed; if
not, be disappointed. 71, 4.

walnuts. to dream of them denotes riches and happiness; to the lover,
success and a good tempered sweetheart. 37, 16.

war. to dream that war exists, and that you see bodies of troops
marching, foretells quarrels and troubles in your family, if you have
one, and if not, among your relatives: if you imagine you see a battle,
the omen is still worse, as the quarrel will probably become public and
notorious. 4, 6, 24.

warming-pan. if any single person dreams that his or her bed is warmed
with one of these utensils, it is a positive forerunner of their
marriage: if a married woman dreams this, it is a sign that she will go
to bed with a strange bedfellow (whether male or female, is not known).
16.

warts. to dream of warts on your left hand is a sign you will receive
some money; if they are on the right hand, it foretells that you will
pay away money: to dream of a wart on the nose, signifies that you will
be distinguished; on the neck or bosom of a female, denotes riches. 65.

washing. to dream of washing, foretells change of abode, and if you
wash in clear, cold water, the dream is an omen of good; but if the
water is dirty or turbid, it is the reverse. if a woman dream she
is washing clothes, it is a sign she will hear good news within
twenty-four hours. 20, 16.

wasp. (_see sting._) to dream of wasps denotes thrift and abundance,
particularly to farmers and those who have fruit-trees. if a girl
dreams that she is stung by a mud-wasp, it foretells that she will
marry a gentleman who will love her dearly. 62, 18.

waste. to dream of waste is a sign of beggary, provided you are the
cause of the waste; but if you feel bad and try to prevent it, the omen
is one of losses, which  not end in beggary. 29, 17.

watch. (_see clock._) if you dream of buying a gold watch, it is a
sign of poverty; but if you imagine that you are presented with one,
it foretells good luck and money-getting: to dream of losing your gold
watch is also a good omen, as it denotes success in business. 42, 11.

watchman. to dream of calling in one, gives confidence: to see a
person taken to prison by a watchman, shows that you must be careful
in conducting your business. if the watchman take hold of you, it is a
very good sign. to see many watchmen together, signifies the loss of
money. 67, 52.

water. to dream of being on the water, is good, if the water be clear;
but if muddy or troubled, the reverse. to see a wide expanse of water,
over or on which you wish to get, but cannot, shows that you are
about to embark in some undertaking without first securing the means
of success. (_see bathing, fountain, pump, pitcher, river, rowing,
sailing, swimming, thirst, washing and well._) 42, 18.

watermelons. (_see melons._)

wedding. (_see marriage._) to dream of being at a jolly wedding, is a
sign of a funeral: if you imagine that you kiss the bride, it foretells
the death of a dear friend or relative. in an old dream-book, published
, it is stated that to dream of kissing the bride, is a sign of
your own death, but on referring to the best authorities, i find it is
necessary to dream that the bride should herself be the kissing party,
and that an impressive kiss from her on the occasion denotes the death
of the person kissed. 42, 78, 2.

well. to dream of looking into a deep well, is a sign you will find a
treasure: if you dream of falling into a deep well, it foretells your
death: if you imagine you draw clear water from a well, and drink it,
you will surely have good fortune of some kind. 7, 14, 77.

wet-nurse. to dream of seeing a wet-nurse suckling a child, is a
sign of venery: to a married man it foretells that he will break his
marriage vows; and to unmarried girls it denotes shame. 7, 9, 63.

whale. to dream of seeing one of these monsters alive in the ocean, is
a sign that you will be in great peril of losing either your life or
property: if you dream that you spear or harpoon a whale successfully,
it foretells great and abundant fortune. 37, 22, 61.

wheat. (_see grain._)

whiskers. if a man dreams that he has very long whiskers or beard, it
foretells that he will commit some folly in connection with a female;
to a married man it shows that he will appear ridiculous from neglect
of his wife and attentions to other women who flatter him; to a single
man, that he will lose caste by foolish, though perhaps not criminal
conduct toward silly girls. 78.

whist. (_see cards._)

whitewash. to dream of having your house or place of business
whitewashed, is an excellent omen, as it promises you good health,
and a good name and repute among your friends: if a woman dreams of
whitewashing her house, or any part of it, it foretells that she will
have a son who will be distinguished, or that some act of hers will
attract public attention. 42, 77.

whore. if a man dreams of associating with one of this class of women,
it foretells losses and disgrace: should a girl dream of playing the
whore, when in fact she is chaste, it foretells her speedy marriage,
and that she will love her husband. 19.

whortleberries. for a girl to dream of picking these berries in
abundance, is a sign she will marry very young and get a good husband,
though not a rich one: to dream of eating whortleberries, denotes
health. 69, 30.

widow. if a girl dreams that she is a widow, it foretells that she will
have many lovers: such a dream to a married woman, denotes that some
man beside her husband is in love with her. 38, 60.

wig. to dream of wearing a wig is a good omen to a bald bachelor, as
it foretells that some lady has a design to catch the poor fellow, and
will not scruple as to the means she uses to accomplish it: if a young
man dreams of wearing a wig, it is a sign that he will sleep with his
sweetheart before he marries her. 3, 6, 69.

will. to dream of making your will is a sign of long life, and good
fortune generally: if you imagine that you make your will to give a
legacy to a lady, it foretells to a man (whether married or single)
that he will marry. 22.

willow. to dream of weeping willows is a sign of sickness and death: if
they hang over a stream, it foretells sickness only. 12, 70.

wine. to dream of drinking wine is a sign of poverty: if a lover dreams
that his sweetheart treats him to a glass of wine, it foretells that
she will be an unthrifty wife. 39.

witch. to dream of a witch foretells that you will leave your home
and sojourn among strangers: if the witch attempts to injure you, it
denotes that you will be dependent upon strangers for your support. no
intelligent person believes in witches, yet a great many dream of them,
and the above is the horoscope of such a dream. 17.

wolf. to dream of being chased by one of these animals, foretells that
you will be cheated in a trade or bargain: if a girl dreams of being
frightened by a wolf, it shows that her lover (if she has one) is a
bad man, and she had better discard him; if she has no lover, some
black-hearted fellow will try to make her acquaintance. 45.

woodchuck. to dream of catching one of these animals, is a sign that
you will be robbed, and that the thief will be detected: if you imagine
you kill the woodchuck, you will probably recover your stolen property.
36, 19.

woods. (_see grove and picnic._)

work. (_see harvest._) to dream that you were working hard, and are
very tired, is a sign of sickness: if you imagine that you see men at
work, it foretells a successful business. 77.

worms. (_see grub._) to dream of fish-worms, such as are dug in
the garden, is a sign of health and good fortune; dreaming of any
destructive worms foretells sickness and losses: if you dream that
worms spin down from a tree and light upon you, it denotes difficulties
and bad luck. 65, 4, 70.

wound. to dream that you are wounded by being stabbed or shot by an
enemy, foretells losses and poverty; if the wounds are accidental, it
still denotes losses, though your general fortune  not be affected.
13, 42.

wren. to dream that one of these musical little birds makes her nest
anywhere on your premises, is a sign of joy and riches; a girl who
dreams this will make a happy match, though perhaps not a rich one, as
the riches only come to the family that lives in the house. 1, 73.

wrinkles. if a lady dreams that her face has become wrinkled, it is a
sign that some one is, or has been, praising her good looks; an old
bachelor who dreams this,  “had better believe” that some young lady is
in love with him, for there is no accounting for taste. 66, 4.

wrist. if a girl dreams that her wrist is large or mis-shapen, it
foretells that she will come to poverty after marriage; if she imagines
that there is a tumor or swelling, or even a wart on it, it is a sign
that she will be dependent on some one for her bread, and that person
 or  not be her husband. 7, 57, 19.

writing. (_see pen and accounts._) to dream of writing a letter,
foretells that absent friends are about to visit you: if a girl dreams
of writing a love-letter, it is a sign that her lover will soon return
and clasp her in his arms, if she allows any such familiarities. to
dream you make a blot while writing, is a sign of sickness. 14.

yacht. to dream you see a yacht under full sail, while you are on
shore, is a sign you will soon fall in love with a pretty maid, or
widow. to dream you are sailing in a yacht with a pleasant breeze, is a
good omen, and denotes success in business, and to lovers, happiness.
dreams of sailing on smooth water are good to all persons, but to dream
the weather is stormy, predicts quarrels and strife. (_see ship and
boat._) 71, 29.

yellow. to dream of having any yellow article presented to you, is
a sign you will get gold: if a girl dreams that her lover gives her
yellow flowers, it foretells that she will marry rich. 60, 41.

yoke. to dream of seeing sleek and healthy cattle yoked together and
acting in harmony, is a sign of a happy marriage: if a girl dreams
this, she will be apt to put her own neck in hymen’s yoke before a
great while. to imagine you see yoked cattle wrangling, and trying to
get their necks out of the yoke, foretells matrimonial troubles, though
it still denotes wedlock to the unmarried. 6, 11.

young. if an old or middle aged person dreams that they are young, it
foretells their death: for a young person to dream that he or she is a
child, the omen is similar; but to dream _of youths_, is a sign that
you will live to a great age. 69, 4.

zebra. to dream of seeing a zebra, is a sign of a quarrel: if you
imagine that somebody presented you with one of these animals, or that
you have purchased it, it foretells, to a young man, that he will marry
a rich but quarrelsome wife, and that she will be constantly annoying
him by bragging of her property. 39, 70, 32.

zouave. (_see parade._) to dream you see zouaves, as well as other
soldiers and armed men, denotes, that you will have quarrels and
trouble in your family, if you have one, and if you have not, among
your relatives: to the single man, this dream foreshadows that his
sweetheart loves another better than himself; and to the maiden it
signifies her lover will try and seduce her. 58, 1, 77.

how to find lucky numbers with dice.


this plan of ascertaining lucky numbers has always been exceedingly
popular with those persons who try their fortune at the lottery. the
manner of calculating a lucky number is as follows: take two dice,
and after shaking them well in a box, throw them out, being careful
to note the whole number of spots on the uppermost sides of the dice,
then repeat this operation and again mark down the number of spots
as before. having done this, you then consult the annexed table and
find the number of your first throw, then follow the line down until
you arrive at the number corresponding with your second throw on the
opposite side of the table. for example, we will suppose you throw the
first time, and the number of spots is equal to 4. you must then look
at the top of the line and find the roman numeral iv. you throw the
second time and get 7 spots; this you will find on the outside column,
at the left hand, marked vii. then all you have to do is to place your
finger on the iv. at the top of the table and follow the line down
until you arrive at vii. on the opposite side of the table, thus you
will find the number 43, which is the lucky number. should you come to
a cypher (0) you must throw again. by following these simple directions
you can get as many good numbers as you wish to play.

                           the shift charm.


on going to bed, take off your under garment and turn it wrong side
outwards; hang it on the back of a chair, having first placed the chair
facing and in front of the bed. while doing this, repeat the following
lines:

  husband approach! and without fear
  sit on this chair, and thus be near
  the girl your heart doth hold most dear
  and if thy love is all sincere,
  to her, this night appear! appear!

you must then get into bed backwards, and sleep in your night-gown
without any shift. you will probably dream of seeing an agreeable young
man, in which case your marriage within that year is certain. if you do
not dream of a man, you will never marry. you should be alone in trying
this charm, for if you speak to any one, or any one in the room speaks,
it breaks it at once.




             fortune-telling with a pack of euchre cards.


take a pack of thirty two cards, such as is used for the game of
euchre. each one of these cards has its own _particular_ signification.
but when taken in connection with other cards its signification is
termed _conditional_.


                particular signification of the cards.

                              ♠ (spades.)

ace: disagreeable tidings—perhaps news of a death.

seven: dangerous illness, or something very unpleasant.

eight: sorrow, vexation.

nine: quarrels, law-suits, high words, blows.

ten: non-fulfilment of a wish—disappointment of a cherished hope,
unforeseen accidents.

                              ♣ (clubs.)

ace: a present, a testimonial of honor and distinction.

seven: an inheritance, gain, profit.

eight: prosperity, wealth, success in business.

nine: proposals of marriage.

ten: good fortune in games of chance, in lottery speculations, finding
a treasure.

                             ♦ (diamonds.)

ace: a letter, news—whether good or bad is determined by the nearest
cards.

seven: travels, a campaign.

eight: a ball, company.

nine: illness—if a knave lies on the right side, you will soon stand
godfather.

ten: a joyful meeting—a long lost friend returned. of the picture cards
we will speak hereafter.

                              ♥ (hearts.)

ace: quiet domestic life—tranquillity.

seven: falling in love—love.

eight: a surprise.

nine: betrothal.

ten: a wedding.

in explaining the cards, my dear readers, to any one, shuffle the pack
three times, and let the person who wishes to know his fortune cut it
three times in succession. then take up the cards, and let the person
in question draw one. this drawn card you place first upon the table.
then spread out the pack in four rows, each containing eight cards.
(_see engraving._)

the first card is of the highest significance. in the first place it
indicates the character of the person inquiring, and according to the
following rule:

 ♠ choleric, passionate, violent.

 ♣ sanguine, cheerful, mirthful, witty.

 ♦ phlegmatic, practical, unexcitable.

 ♥ melancholic, sentimental, poetical, talented.

as, however, the human character is never without more than one of
the above named characteristics, the first card signifies the most
prominent one, and the cards which lie on the right side and below it
are reckoned with it, by which the meaning of the first card is either
modified or corroborated.

if the person in question is a lady, and she has, for example, drawn
a club, the queen of clubs is herself, the knave of clubs is her
intended, the king her father, or uncle, as the case  be. the
picture cards of the other black suit are her friends and relations.
it is the same if she has drawn hearts or diamonds, only that in this
case the picture cards of the other red suit signify her friends and
relations. if the person inquiring is a gentleman, it is the same,
except that he is the knave of the suit which he has drawn, and his
intended the queen.

from this first card, also, you form a judgment of one’s whole future
course in life. if its signification is joyful, the person’s life will
be a happy one. if, for example, it is the ace of hearts, it indicates
that the person will never be without a home, a dear and pleasant home
to him; if it is the ace of clubs, he will pass through life enjoying
honor and fame; if it is the ten of hearts with a female figure on
either side, it signifies two wives; if with a male figure on either
side, and the person inquiring is a female, two husbands.

[illustration: example of fortune-telling with an euchre pack of cards.]

thus much as to general rules. we will now instruct the reader how to
explain the cards in detail. we will suppose that it is a lady who
inquires of the cards, and endeavor, by means of an example, to give an
accurate explanation of the method to be pursued. spread out the cards
before you, and observe carefully the different cards while you read
the fortune i shall predict from them. (_see engraving, page 96._)

ace of hearts.—the young lady’s character, it seems, is sentimental,
melancholic, poetical, which three qualities are found more or
less together. if the next card were a heart, it would indicate a
temperament inclined to love. as, however, the adjacent cards are clubs
and spades, of which two indeed are clubs, we conclude that the lady
often displays a cheerful, sanguine disposition, yet can, at times, be
very passionate. the main feature of her character, however, is the
melancholic.

we will now look around for the lady herself—she is found to be the
seventh card on the last row. her lover, on the other hand, is the
eighth card in the second row. as he precedes her, this signifies
that she is already acquainted with him, and they seem already to
love one another, as a love card lies at his side, and also one at
hers; no card, however, lies between them to connect them, except the
queen of diamonds. this, however, is not altogether favorable, for a
queen between a loving pair signifies a rival (for a gentleman, the
knave signifies the same), and can as well indicate a separation as a
union, notwithstanding its similarity of color. the general rule is
as follows:—if the card which connects the queen and knave is of the
same color with them, it indicates a future union between the persons.
(hearts and diamonds form one color, as do clubs and spades.)

one thing more: from the cards which lie next to the knave, we are
enabled to judge of the character and occupation of the lady’s
intended. in the present case, the cards next to the knave of hearts
are two spades, two diamonds, and one heart; his character, therefore,
according to the rules already given, is choleric, yet at times
melancholic and sentimental. in his daily conduct he is practical and
considerate.

as to his occupation, the different colors have the following
signification:

 ♠ a student, probably a clergyman.

 ♣ a lawyer—jurist.

 ♦ a mechanic, merchant, or a person who has chosen for
himself some practical career.

 ♥ a capitalist, a genius who devotes himself to some
favorite pursuit, also a military man.

the card at the right hand is commonly the decisive one, but as, in the
present case, there is no right hand card, the one at the left takes
its place; according to this, the lady’s intended is a capitalist, a
genius, or a military man.

we now proceed to tell the lady’s fortune in its particulars.

we commence from the ace of hearts, thus: a considerable windfall will
happen in your family, young lady. either you or your parents will draw
a prize in the lottery, or heaven will drop some other nice morsel into
your mouth (ten of clubs).

this will give occasion to a journey, which you will take with an
acquaintance (king of spades and seven of diamonds). this journey will
be very agreeable to you, and especially will you enjoy yourself at
a ball, to which you will be invited by a friend of your travelling
companion (knave of clubs and eight of diamonds). you will then dance
a cotillion with a relative of your intended, perhaps with your own
brother-in-law that is to be (knave of diamonds).

when you return home, you will find a letter, at the sight of which you
will be disturbed, the hand-writing being that of a person unfriendly
to you (queen of spades, ace of spades). you open it, and behold it
is a proposal of marriage (nine of clubs), and from a relative of the
gentleman who invited you to the ball (king of clubs), which touches
the (nine of clubs).

as, however, you promise yourself nothing but vexation (eight of
spades) from this marriage, you refuse him (ten of spades), and it will
soon appear that a better fortune lies before you (eight of clubs).
soon after, a wedding takes place (ten of hearts), namely, that of
your sister or friend (queen of diamonds), who, therefore, does not
stand between you and your intended to separate you, but to unite you.
the bridegroom is the gentleman who was your partner in the cotillion
at that ball (knave of diamonds). at this wedding you will among
others see your intended (knave of hearts), with whom you are already
acquainted. you will also meet there a gentleman, who, when you last
saw him, was dangerously ill (seven of spades, knave of spades, and ten
of diamonds). your intended seizes the opportunity to offer himself to
you, and you become betrothed to him (nine of hearts). you will receive
a present from a relative or friend, perhaps from your brother (ace of
clubs, and king of diamonds).

something now occurs to separate you from your betrothed (nine of
spades). it almost seems as if you were jealous of a lady whom he
formerly loved (queen of clubs, seven of hearts). a very tender letter
which he writes to you, from a bed of sickness upon which his grief has
prostrated him (ace of diamonds, nine of diamonds), soon reconciles
you again, and as not long after something occurs which places him
in a position to support a wife in comfort (seven of clubs), the
happy marriage is celebrated. dear relatives (king of hearts, king of
diamonds, and queen of diamonds) prepare for you joyful surprises,
which combine to render this day an infinitely happy one.

one thing more: if the ten of hearts is the last card in the last row,
the person in question will never marry; otherwise, each row counts a
year. you first count the rows until you come to the nine of hearts
(the betrothal), you then begin again and count to the ten of hearts
(the wedding), that is, in case the nine comes after the ten. if the
nine comes before the ten, you continue to count without recommencing.

the young lady in question will therefore be betrothed in from two to
three years, and will be married in about two years after, for the nine
of hearts lies in the third row, and the ten in the second row. she has
then almost five years to enjoy her single life before she becomes a
wife.


            to find out whom one is to have for a husband.

you select the four kings from a pack, and lay them side by side in a
row upon the table.

the lady who wishes to know her fortune gives to each of these cards
the name of some gentleman of her acquaintance who might be likely to
woo her in marriage. it is usual to pronounce these names aloud before
the company. the name given to the king of hearts is, however, an
exception. this secret the lady keeps to herself. to these four kings,
you can also add a queen, which then denotes the old maid.

now, take the rest of the pack, shuffle it thoroughly, let the person
in question cut three times and commence. under each of the above
named picture cards you lay a card in turn, and as often as a spade is
placed under a spade, a heart under a heart, &c., that is, as often as
a card of the same suit is placed under one of these picture cards, the
picture card is turned from its position.

the first time it takes a direction from left to right, the second time
it lies upside down, the third time it is raised again to a position
from right to left, and the fourth and last time it regains its former
upright position.

that one of the four kings, who, after these different changes, first
resumes his upright position, is to be the happy husband. if it should
happen to be the old maid, you can imagine what is in store for you.

after having learned from the cards who is to be the husband, the
questions next asked are, usually: how much will he love his wife,
why he marries her, and what is his profession. these questions are
answered in the following manner:

gather up the cards, shuffle them thoroughly, and let the person cut
them three times. then tell off the cards upon the table, as you recite
the following sentence:

  heartily, painfully,
  beyond all measure,
  by fits and starts,
  not a bit in the world.

you repeat this sentence until the king of hearts makes his appearance.
if it happens that, as you lay this upon the table, you pronounce the
word  “heartily,” he will love his future wife heartily, and so on.

now, as to why he marries her. count off the cards upon the table,
while you repeat the following sentence:

    for love, for her beauty,
    for his parents’ command,
    for her bright, golden dollars,
    for counsel of friends.

the sentence by which you discover what is his profession is the
following:

    gentleman, alderman, clergyman, doctor,
    merchant, broker, professor, major,
    mechanic, lawyer, shipmaster, tailor.

this method of telling fortunes is very entertaining in society, when
you have not the book to find more particular answers.


     a method by which to discover if your wish will be fulfilled.

take a pack of cards, shuffle it, and let the person inquiring cut
three times; then place singly five cards upon the table, and upon each
of these cards another, taken from the top, and so on, until the pack
is exhausted, and the cards are divided into five nearly equal heaps.

the person in question now selects a suit, spades or clubs, &c.—or a
card  previously be drawn to determine the suit.

suppose diamonds is the chosen suit: you take up the first heap, and
throw away all the cards until you come to a matadore of diamonds.
(the matadores are the ace, king, queen, knave and ten.) you do the
same with the other heaps. if any one of the heaps does not contain a
matadore, you cast it entirely aside.

the heaps which are left you now place one upon another in order,
beginning at the left hand, and, without shuffling them, you lay them
in five heaps, and proceed as before. this time there are, of course,
fewer cards, beside matadores, than before. after having cast aside the
cards which you meet with before finding a matadore, you take up the
heaps, and, without shuffling them, lay them in five heaps, for the
third time. this third and last time, you must, if your wish is to be
fulfilled, be able to discard all the cards except the matadores. if
any other cards are left in the heaps, your wish will not be granted.




                telling fortunes by dominoes and dice.


the telling of fortunes by the spots on dominoes and dice is a very
ancient custom, and has always been practised by the most celebrated
astrologers and fortune-tellers. the calculations have all to be made
by drawing a horoscope from each domino and the spots on each side of a
die; therefore the process is exceedingly tedious. we have given in the
following pages the results of three years’ experimental labor on this
subject; not constant labor, for there are but a few hours in each
year when the stars are in the right position to draw the horoscope of
any particular domino. a good many of the signs predicted here have
been proved to be correct within the personal knowledge of the writer,
and he doubts not they will all be found to be accurate.


               method of telling fortunes with dominoes.

[illustration: dominoes placed in a circle]

shuffle the dominoes well on a smooth table, with their faces downward,
then draw one and see what it signifies according to the description
given below.

it is useless for any person to draw more than three dominoes at one
time of trial, or in one and the same month, as they will only deceive
themselves. shuffle the dominoes each time of choosing; to draw the
same domino twice makes the answer stronger.

be very particular and do not attempt to tell your fortune by dominoes
on _friday_ or _monday_.


                    signification of the dominoes.

double-six. denotes much riches by speculation, and a happy and
prolific marriage. it is not good to farmers as far as relates to crops
and success in their calling, but it foretells that their lands will
rise in value, and that they can make money by selling out. if a girl
turns this domino to learn her fate in matrimonial matters, it is a
sign she will marry rich, and have a large family of children.

six-five. if you are in search of employment, this domino shows
that you will succeed by proper perseverance. if in love, do not be
discouraged by any rebuffs, for success awaits you. if you have planted
a crop, or about to plant one, it will yield nobly. in money matters
exclusively, you  not be fortunate, as the domino is not lucky for
money. if your wife is about to give birth to a child, and you try your
fortune with special reference to such birth, this domino foretells its
early death. if you are about to buy real estate, you will be lucky in
the purchase—if to buy silverware, jewelry, or a watch, you will get
cheated. if you expect a legacy, you will probably be lucky and get it.

six-four. this domino denotes early marriage and much happiness; the
sexes of the children will be about equally divided, and they will
live, but will leave home early—the girls to marry, and the boys to do
for themselves. it denotes neither poverty nor riches.

six-three. this domino denotes constancy and affection. it is an
excellent domino for lovers, who will marry early, and enjoy much
happiness. it is also a sign of riches and honors; and no troubles of
any account will mar your fortune. there is some danger, however, that
you will die at middle age, but if you survive that period you will
live to a good old age.

six-two. is an excellent domino for lovers, as it foretells a happy
marriage. a gentleman turning this domino, will get an orderly and
economical wife, and a lady will have equal good fortune in a thrifty
and industrious husband. those who turn this domino for luck in
business matters, will realize all and more than they expect. to
dishonest and selfish people, however, the domino is fatal. if it is
turned to determine the result of any scheme that is not fair and
above-board, it foretells ill-success and exposure. to a married
lady who expects to present her husband with an heir, it presents a
beautiful and healthy child, and one who will excel as a mathematician,
and (if a boy) will probably become distinguished.

six-one. this domino foretells to young people that they will marry
twice, and the second marriage will be the happiest of the two. to
married people it is a sign they will be better off in middle age than
when young, and that one child will be faithful and remain with them,
while the others will seek their fortunes away from home.

six-blank. if you turn this domino you will hear of the death of an
esteemed friend, or an acquaintance—will experience the loss of a
relative or member of your family—or some one will die in whom you are
interested. to a farmer, or the owner of horses or other animals, it
 denote the loss of some of the animals rather than human beings;
but it foretells death in some shape, and  even mean to warn you of
your own decease.

double-five. is a decidedly lucky domino in everything you undertake.
it foretells success in all enterprises, but does not assure you that
you will become rich.

five-four. this domino shows to a lady that she will probably marry a
poor man, have a large family of children, and then become a widow. he
 be pretty well off, to appearance, when she marries him, but if it
be so, she will find that he has debts and expensive habits that will
bring him to poverty and the grave. it is not a good domino for money
matters, for if you have lost money, or if people owe you, the turning
of this domino shows that you will not be apt to get the cash. to a
farmer it is a sign of good crops; but it is also a sign that something
unfortunate will occur in connection with the farm—such as cattle lost
or injured, or property of some kind destroyed.

five-three. denotes ample means, without any other peculiarity of
fortune. if you turn this domino you  calculate you will never be
poor, and  become quite wealthy. but to one already wealthy, it
shows that though he  not become poor, he will never be any better
off than he then is, and perhaps not so well off. to young people
the domino denotes comfortable circumstances after marriage, but not
over-zealous love. it shows no positive bad luck in love matters, at
the same time that it does not assure you of devoted attachment of your
proposed partner for life, of either sex. on the whole, it is a pretty
fair domino for any one to turn.

five-two. if you are in love, you will probably be unfortunate; for
though you  get the person you want, and an apparently happy
marriage  follow, it will prove an unhappy one in the end.
nevertheless, your happiness  continue for some time after marriage.
to a gentleman this domino foretells a thrifty and industrious wife,
though one with an unhappy temper or disposition. to a single lady it
denotes thrift and independence as long as she remains single. if a man
is engaged in a speculation, or is about starting any new enterprise,
he will not be likely to succeed. if you are a candidate for office,
you will be defeated. on the whole, this is not a lucky domino for
gentlemen, though for ladies it is a pretty fair one.

five-one. is a jolly domino for persons fond of excitement. it predicts
that you will receive an invitation to a dinner, or social gathering,
or to some place where you will enjoy yourself. if a married lady turns
this domino it is a sign she will present her husband with a triple
addition to his family—all boys. to a young lady it predicts a beau,
who will not be rich or refined, but rather a rough customer, and she
will discard him and marry another. if you expect to earn or to receive
money, this domino is one of disappointment.

five-blank. if a man turns it, he will be either a gambler or a rich
rogue, if he has brains enough, and if his intellect is not sufficient,
he will probably be a small swindler, or the favored lover of a lewd
woman, or both. although these will be his characteristics, yet
circumstances  place him in a different position; but he will always
be mercenary, selfish, impudent, and without pride of character. to a
girl this domino foretells an unhappy marriage, and misfortune by that
means; but if she remains single, and keeps clear of lovers, she will
avoid the ill omen.

double-four. is a good and smooth domino for lovers, for farmers, and
for laboring people of all kinds. on the contrary, lawyers, doctors,
or professional men who turn it, will probably have a spell of hard
times to encounter. to little girls and boys it predicts that they
will soon be invited to a party, and have much pleasure. if any one is
about to give a party, and turns this domino, he or she  count on a
first-rate time, for everything will go on well, and the party will be
a decided success. it likewise predicts that a wedding will come off
very soon.

four-three. those who turn this domino will marry young, live happily,
and will not probably have more than one child that will live. it
denotes neither poverty nor riches. to a couple who are childless, it
is a sign of a second marriage. if a married person who has children
turns this domino, it is a sign that the family will be reduced by
death or long absence.

four-two. foretells a change in your circumstances, condition, family,
relations, or your ideas. it is not known what the change will be,
but that there will really be a change, fate has ordained. it  be
nothing at all serious, or it  be something that will affect your
whole life. for instance, a young person who turns this domino  get
married—that will be an important change, but whether the marriage will
be a happy one, is not known. a married person  lose their partner—a
man  fail in business, or  become pious and join the church—a
family  break up housekeeping and take board, or  lose a favorite
child. indeed, a thousand little incidents  occur in life which will
cause a change in your usual routine. to farmers and persons who work
hard for a living, the change will probably be a favorable or happy
one. to rich and lazy people it will be an unfortunate one. to any
other than these two classes it is uncertain what the nature of it will
be. if you have offended your lover, or any particular friend, this
domino shows that you will soon make up and become stronger friends
than ever. it is a lucky domino for farmers in business matters,
although it does not point out any particular good fortune that awaits
them.

four-one. those who turn this domino will marry happily, and no
uncommon event will mar their nuptials: the omen connected with it
usually points to childless couples who are well off; and i find
that where children are born, the parties will lose their wealth and
position in proportion to the number of their offspring, which will
never exceed four. in most cases there will be no children, but ample
means.

four-blank. is an unfortunate domino for lovers, as it foretells
quarrels and separations, old maids and old bachelors. a girl who has
a lover, and turns this domino to find out his peculiarities, had
better look somewhere else at once, for she will certainly either lose
or discard him. it is the same with a gentleman—he will never marry
the girl he then expects to, and  be jilted. to married people the
domino gives a prolific promise. a married lady who turns it will
probably have twins or triplets at her next maternity. if you think
to entrust a secret to a friend, this domino denotes that it will not
be kept. it also foretells that your future husband or wife will be a
very credulous person—perhaps a believer in spiritualism or some other
absurd doctrine.

double-three. denotes immense riches, but has no allusion to matrimony.
it is an excellent domino for any one to turn, as it points to money
in abundance, and does not intimate any unhappiness: therefore, the
person who turns it will get plenty of cash, and be happy or not, as
fate  ordain.

three-two. is a fortunate domino in the following cases: marriage,
love-making, recovering stolen property, going on a journey, entering
into a speculation, planting a crop, collecting a debt, or making a
purchase. this domino shows also that you  be lucky in collecting
some old claim or debt that you had given up as lost. it is bad for
gamblers, for a woman about to give birth to a child, and for peddlers.

three-one. a young girl who turns this domino will be in danger of
losing her chastity; therefore let her be careful. a married woman
turning it will have an outside admirer who will flatter her with a
view to an improper intimacy. to a man it foretells the loss of money
through his illicit intercourse with the opposite sex. it is not a
favorable domino to any one.

three-blank. this domino denotes that your sweetheart is artful and
deceitful. if you get married, your wife will be either shrewish, or
vain and unprincipled, and perhaps run away and disgrace you. to a girl
it foretells a putty-head of a husband—one who is easily influenced,
and whom she can wind round her finger. if you turn this domino, it
is a sign you will soon be invited to a party and there make a new
acquaintance, with whom you will afterwards have a quarrel. if a
married man or woman turns it, it predicts a family quarrel.

double-two. the turning of this domino denotes success in love matters
and much happiness in the married state, together with good children
who will live and be prosperous. it also denotes success in any
undertaking, and thrift, though not great riches.

two-one. the turning of this domino denotes to a lady that she will
marry young, and that her husband will die, leaving her a large
property, and childless. for a long time she will be a gay, rich widow,
but will be caught at last, and marry happily. to a young man it
denotes a life of luxury; he will never marry, but will be a favorite
of the ladies, and have several mistresses. it is not a good domino for
business men, as it foretells losses by failures.

two-blank. the turning of this domino denotes poverty and bad luck. to
a marriageable young woman it predicts a poor, dissipated and dishonest
husband. on the birth of a child—if a boy, it is a sign that he will be
poor and shiftless, and perhaps dishonest—if a girl, that she will not
marry well. it is not a bad domino for a girl who lives unmarried, for
she  do very well alone. it is a domino of good luck to thieves and
bad people. if they turn it, it is a sign of success in any dishonest
undertaking. should you turn this domino in reference to a journey, it
shows that you will go in safety. it predicts an easy deliverance in
case you are attacked and should be obliged to defend yourself.

double-ace. denotes affectionate constancy and happiness in the
marriage state. it is an excellent domino to turn, both for lovers and
married people, as besides the above it indicates a competency of this
world’s goods.

double-blank. to turn this domino is the worst sign in the whole set,
and is only favorable to misers, usurers, gamblers, and unprincipled
cheats and seducers. to any heartless, selfish person, the turning of
this domino foretells good luck—to all others disappointment. we hope
that no young girl turning a domino to ascertain her fortune as to
marriage will turn this one, for it surely foretells disappointment and
sorrow. if she has a lover, and should he marry her, he will desert
her afterwards. in business matters, too, it is decidedly unfavorable,
and is a sign that your business will decrease. if you are wanting a
situation, you will not be likely to get it, and if anything is lost
or stolen, it will not probably be recovered again. it is generally
a pretty bad domino for decent people—but a good one for all the
dishonest ones, who, if they have got anything by trickery and fraud,
will be apt to enjoy it.


                 method of telling fortunes with dice.

take three dice, shake them well in the box with your left hand, and
then cast them out on a board or table, on which you have previously
drawn a circle with chalk; count the number of spots on the uppermost
sides of the dice, and look at the signification of the numbers, as
given below. be careful and do not attempt to tell your fortune on
mondays or wednesdays, as they are unlucky days for dice. to throw the
same number twice at one trial, shows news from abroad, be the numbers
what they . if the dice roll over the circle, the number thrown goes
for nothing, but the occurrence shows sharp words, and if they fall to
the floor, it is blows; in throwing out the dice, if one remains on top
of the other, it is a present of which i leave the ladies to take care.


                  signification of the spots on dice.

three. if a young girl throws this number, (three aces,) it foretells
that she will have numerous lovers, and if she marries will have a good
crop of children, and then become a widow. to a young man it denotes
that he will never marry, but will be a great favorite of the ladies,
and probably a gay seducer. if a married person throws it, he or she
will become a widower or widow, as the case  be.

four. to throw this number denotes frivolity in love matters. unmarried
persons who throw it will have many lovers or sweethearts, and will not
be fully satisfied with either. it foretells to a married woman that
her husband admires the sex generally quite as much as he does her; but
it also denotes that she will have many children, and that both herself
and husband will live to raise them.

five. to throw this number of spots of the dice, foretells good luck
in a land speculation to any one who is about buying lands. it is a
very good number for farmers, prognosticating a fortunate season to
come. to lovers it shows that some obstacle will present itself to
their marriage, or else that they will quarrel. in a family it is a
sign that some person will soon visit there that is not welcome. if you
are about to go a journey, and throw this number, you will meet some
one who will bother you, or that you dislike, or else some disagreeable
accident will happen; but the accident will not be serious.

six. if a girl throws this number, (three deuces,) it denotes that she
will be of gay disposition and have many lovers, but will never marry;
if she escapes illicit connections, she will be fortunate, and probably
get some money by will. to a young man it denotes that he will marry
a gay wife, who will be of loose principles; and also that he himself
will keep a mistress, and perhaps become a gambler. he will not be poor
as long as he is young and attractive, but he will either die young or
become poor in middle age. to gamblers, the throwing of this number is
a sign of success in winning money.

seven. if a man throws this number it foretells that he will never
marry, but will be lucky in business speculations. a young lady who
throws it will be apt to marry a wealthy husband, though he  not
be an agreeable companion. to farmers and mechanics it is not a
particularly bad number, though it does not promise them much success,
and it foretells that they will have pretty hard work to keep even with
the world.

eight. this is the miser’s throw; those who throw it will probably
be well off, though not rich. it foretells a miserly or stingy
disposition, and a character too close in money matters to be very
prosperous. if a girl throw this to test the character of her lover,
she  be assured that he will not be poor, though it is possible he
 lead her an unhappy life from his selfish and penurious habits.

nine. if you throw this number with the dice with reference to your
future husband or wife, be assured that you will be lucky in your
choice. it foretells an orderly, energetic and industrious person. i
should not want a better wife than this number predicts. to a young
girl it does not promise riches with a husband, but it foretells thrift
and plenty, and that she  be rich, too. it is a fair business throw
also—foretelling pretty good luck in everything except games of chance,
and predicting bad luck in such games.

ten. if a young girl throws this number, she will not marry very soon,
and perhaps not at all; but she will have good luck in other matters,
and rise above her present position in society. if a man throws it, he
will get a rich wife. it is a favorable number to the male sex in love
matters. a married woman who throws it will rise in the world, or have
a legacy left to her.

eleven. this throw foretells extravagance and fondness of show and
display. those who throw it, or for whose fortune it  be thrown,
will probably have the command of means, but all will be spent in
gimcracks, parties of pleasure, and in adorning the person; and though
they  not come to poverty, they will leave nothing but debt to
their heirs. to laboring people it denotes that they will be always in
debt, and live above their means.

twelve. shows that an event of some kind is soon to occur in your
affairs, either for good or evil. to a farmer or a laboring man it
will probably be fortunate, but it  be otherwise. to a banker, a
money-dealer, or a jeweler, it is generally a bad omen—to other trades,
uncertain. it has no special reference to love matters.

thirteen. i hope no virtuous young girl will ever be so unfortunate as
to throw this number, unless she be possessed of a resolution as firm
as a rock, for it foretells that she will be sorely tempted to become
profligate. it is emphatically the throw of an unchaste female. if a
man throws this number, it is a sign that he will never marry, but will
associate with harlots, or live with a woman who is not his wife; if he
throws it with a view to discover the character of his lady-love, he
 guess the result.

fourteen. this is the gambler’s throw, and denotes dishonesty and an
unprincipled disposition in men, and misfortune in women. if a man
throws it, he will be either a gambler or a rich rogue, if he has
brains enough, and if his intellect is not sufficient, he will probably
be a small swindler, or the favored lover of a lewd woman, or both.
although these will be his characteristics, yet circumstances  place
him in a different position, but he will always be mercenary, selfish,
impudent, and without pride of character. to a girl this number
foretells an unhappy marriage, and misfortune by that means; but if she
remains single, and keeps clear of lovers, she will avoid the ill omen.

fifteen. if you are a speculating character—a buyer of lottery tickets
or lottery policies, or are engaged in any games of chance, such as
gambling, horse-racing, shooting at a mark, betting, or in fact any
scheme that you expect to win money by, this number foretells bad luck
and discomfiture. if you try to test your luck in any such matters, and
this number turns up, you  be sure you will lose, and had better
give up at once. if you want to buy land, you will be apt to get a good
bargain and be fortunate. this number foretells good luck to a farmer
putting in his crops, and the same to a girl choosing a husband; for
though she  not get a rich man, yet he will be industrious, thrifty,
comfortable, and good-hearted. to consumptive people this throw is not
a favorable one, as in many cases it predicts a short life to them.

sixteen. this is an unlucky number to a merchant, a banker, or a
mechanic. it foretells bad luck of some kind, though it is generally
a forerunner of a brisk and profitable business. an excellent run of
business  come first, and the bad luck afterwards, or _vice versa_,
but the misfortune is sure to come in somewhere. to a farmer this throw
foretells abundant crops, and to a gold-digger good luck and plenty
of the precious metal. a young girl who throws it will get a thrifty
husband, and have a numerous family.

seventeen. if you are a girl, and think of getting married, you will
be apt to lose your lover unless he is a farmer, a gardener, a
well-digger, a gold-miner, a brewer, a coal-heaver, a grave-digger,
or some occupation that makes him use a shovel a good deal. if you
think of marrying any such man, this throw is a good one. for a man
of any other occupation, it foretells disappointment. to a young man,
this number shows that by perseverance and industry he will do well in
the world—that his luck will be good if he only tries his best to get
along. if you have had anything stolen from you, or have lost valuable
property while walking or riding, this throw is unfavorable; you will
probably never recover what you have lost.

eighteen. people who throw this number  congratulate themselves,
as it foretells riches, honors, and a happy and contented life. it
predicts unexceptionable prosperity in all kinds of business, good luck
in love matters, and advancement to those who are honorably ambitious.
to rogues and dishonest people it is an omen of discomfiture, detection
and punishment.




                              palmistry,

             or telling fortunes by the lines of the hand.


many people think the predictions from lines in the hand are all
guess-work, but it is a mistake, for they are determined by simple
rules and long observation. let us explain the matter:

in the first place each finger has its name.

  (1)  forefinger:         jupiter  ♃
  (2)  middle finger:      saturn   ♄
  (3)  ring finger:        the sun  ⨀
  (4)  little finger:      mercury  ☿
  (5)  thumb:              venus    ♀

each hand has five main lines.

  (1)  the life line:        l. vitalis.
  (2)  the natural line:     l. naturalis.
  (3)  the table line:       l. mensalis.
  (4)  the liver line:       l. hepatica.
  (5)  the wrist line:       l. rascetta.

(_see engraving._)


                           1. linea vitalis.

if this line is wanting or nearly so, it is by no means a good sign. it
signifies a feeble understanding, a faint heart, and a short, sickly
life. this, however, is not the signification in every case; it often
indicates, especially with the ladies, changeableness of feeling, a
disposition easily influenced by others, and a proneness to enthusiasm.

[illustration: palm of hand showing the principle lines viz.
  _mensalis_  _naturalis_  _hepatica_  _vitalis_  _rascetta_]

the length of life is in proportion to the length of the line of life.
it begins between ♃ and ♀ and it is here that you commence with the
prophecy.

each knot in this line denotes an obstacle, or, at least, something
momentous in life. each crossing by smaller lines, some unpleasant
occurrence. the larger the cross, the greater the misfortune.

in most cases one or more lines run from the natural line to the line
of life. this indicates the partner of one’s life. the point where the
junction takes place denotes the point of time of the marriage. if this
occurs near the commencement of the line, of course the marriage will
take place early in life. if two lines unite with the line of life it
indicates two husbands (or wives). if no line joins it, the person will
remain unmarried.

the clearer and more distinct the line of life, the happier the
person’s life. when it is fine, deep and sharply defined, it denotes an
energetic, and at the same time a noble character.


                          2. linea naturalis.

a regular length and good appearance of this line denotes excellent
digestive organs. large crosses occurring in its course signify
imprudence, precipitation.


                          3. linea mensalis.

if it is well defined it indicates an amorous temperament; if
accompanied by a side line, it signifies good fortune in love and
wedlock. if it is very broad, happiness in domestic life. if it is
interrupted it denotes that sad calamity, infidelity.


                          4. linea hepatica.

if it is complete and tolerably long, it promises robust health, a
clear understanding, and good humor. if it throws out branches near its
commencement it signifies wit, acuteness, presence of mind, a spirit of
mischief, perhaps falsehood.


                          5. linea rascetta.

when it is complete and unbroken, it denotes good fortune in all
matters of importance.

from the ring finger (solis ⨀) there commonly runs one or more lines
into the linea mensalis. these denote the various inclinations of
the heart. if but a single line is actually visible, and if this is
deep and long, the person loves or will love faithfully and warmly.
if a number of smaller lines are found in its place, the person is
inconstancy itself, a butterfly roving from flower to flower. add up
all these little lines, and the sum will give you the number of times
the person will fall in love.

necessary for the reader’s instruction. to enter more deeply into the

[illustration: head showing location of the above organs.]

according as these organs are more or less elevated and well formed
that peculiarity of character which they indicate is more or less
present.

physiognomy, or the features of the head and face, teaches us to judge
of the character of a person and of events connected with his destiny
from the shape, color and expression of his features. if my fair
readers would like to know how many husbands they are to have, they
have only to knit their eyebrows closely together, and count the folds
of the skin formed by this movement.

if they wish to see how many years they have to live, let them elevate
their brows as much as possible, and then count the cross folds in the
forehead. subtract the number found from one hundred, and the remainder
is the number of the years which it is allotted you to pass upon this
earth.

of the nose. a bold, projecting nose, usually called a roman nose,
denotes an enterprising temper. in general a large nose is a good sign.
a long nose is a sign of good sense, a stumpy one generally indicates
the contrary. a perfectly straight nose denotes a high and noble
spirit, unless the expression of the eyes contradicts this judgment,
and then it denotes great stupidity. a turned up nose signifies a
spirit of mischief, wit, forwardness, that is, if it is not too
stumpy. a very small nose indicates good nature, yet at the same time
a complete want of energy. a red nose denotes a cheerful temper, or an
inclination to drink, as all the world knows.

of the lips. very thick lips indicate either great stupidity or very
great genius. very fine thin lips denote falsehood, especially if
they are usually compressed. swelling lips, if generally compressed,
denote great decision of character, a philosophical turn of mind, and
oftentimes somewhat of obstinacy. a mouth always open says as plain as
words can speak,  “i am a calf.”

of dimples. dimples in the cheeks signify roguery. but the dimple in
the chin the god of love has himself imprinted with his own divine
finger.

of the eye. the soul, however, dwells particularly in the eyes, and the
faculty is inborn with every man to understand their language without
ever having studied it. at least it should be so; the eyes should be
like an open book, which all  read and understand. but as all eyes
are not to be trusted, and will sometimes lead you astray, i will give
you, my dear readers, a few rules to guide you in your path through
life.

a clear eye, with the pupil in continual, slightly tremulous movement,
denotes a good memory, yet something of selfishness with slowness of
comprehension.

an eye which, while the person speaks, roves hither and thither,
denotes a deceiver. very quiet eyes which have an imposing effect
upon you, and embarrass you by their great repose, signify great
self-command, yet, at the same time, great self-complacency.

eyes which ordinarily appear impressive, yet often suddenly flash forth
a clear pleasant light, denote true-heartedness and honesty, coupled
with a sound understanding.

eyes which have always an inquisitive expression in them, and then
suddenly, when they turn to address a person, have an exceedingly kind
expression, are not to be trusted. this indicates a suspicious temper,
and he who does not trust his fellow-man, can seldom himself be trusted.

an eye in which the white has a yellowish tinge, and is streaked with
reddish veins, denotes vehement passions.

very blue eyes, betray a temper inclined to coquetry.

gray eyes, intelligence.

greenish, falsehood, and a disposition to tittle-tattle.

yellowish, great phlegm.

black, a passionate lively temperament.

brown, a kind, good, happy disposition.

a pair of eyes which looks every one cheerfully and frankly in the
face, with an air of simple joy and unaffected innocence, yet, when
surprised, droops to the ground, with a certain sly bashfulness, or,
when offended by another’s glance, turns aside blushing and confused,
such a pair of eyes, indicates an amiable character, a faithful heart,
a sound understanding, and a pure soul.

a being with such a pair of eyes we cannot help loving, let the eyes be
black, brown, blue, gray, green, or yellow, let the nose be stumpy, and
the features ill-shaped, no one can help regarding their possessor with
a feeling of hearty kindness and good will, if not with actual love.

of the eye-brows. upright eyebrows are amiable; the eyebrows hanging
over, indicate an effeminate person; the brows very hairy, denote an
industrious, affectionate man; the brows extending to the temples,
usually signify a slovenly man.

of the ears. open ears usually indicate but little reason; great ears
not too much wisdom; very small ears foolishness; square ears of medium
size, prudence.

of the nostrils. the nostrils thick and strong, betoken strength; if
round, fair, and drawn in length, they are a sign that the person is
merry and courageous; if narrow and round, they are mostly indicative
of an envious and foolish person.

of the mouth. a very large mouth, with the upper lip hanging over,
usually signifies a foolish, unsteady person, a rash man and a babbler.
a mouth not too large, indicates a bold and courageous man; and a small
mouth, a clever man.

of the face. a lean face is an indication of a wise man; the face plain
and fat, denotes a person addicted to strife. the face without any
rising and swelling, indicates a penurious person; a sad face sometimes
denotes foolishness, and at other times wisdom; a fat face indicates a
man to be inclined to untruth; a round face signifies folly; a great
face denotes a man slow about business; a well-proportioned face
indicates a person to have virtuous qualities.

of the nails on the fingers. broad nails show the person to be bashful,
fearful, but of gentle nature. when there is a certain white mark at
the extremity of them, it shows that the person has more honesty than
subtlety. white long nails denote much sickness, but are sometimes
indicative of strength and deceit. if upon the white anything appears
at the extremity that is pale, it denotes short life; but if the white
is clear and smooth, it signifies long life.

of the head. a large head shows a person stupid, and dull of
apprehension; also a very small head signifies the same; but the head
of a man being neither great nor small, is the prognostic of a wise
man; for all extremes are irregular and a deviation from nature, and
experience has made it manifest, that a great head and small members do
always produce great indiscretion and folly in either man or woman; but
we must also consider the several parts of the head: and first,

of the forehead. a large forehead shows a liberal man; but the
forehead narrow, denotes a foolish person; a long forehead shows one
apt to learn; a high forehead, swelling and round, is a sign of a
crafty man, and a coward; a forehead full of wrinkles, shows a man to
be envious and crafty.

but in forming your opinions of men from these or other indications,
you should always bear in mind that there is no rule without an
exception.




                       fortune-telling by moles.


these little marks on the skin, although they appear to be the effect
of chance, or accident, and might easily pass with the unthinking
for things of no moment, are nevertheless of the utmost consequence,
since from their color, situation, size, and figure,  be accurately
gathered the temper of, and the events that will happen to the person
bearing them; though moles are, in their substances, nothing else
than excrescences, or ebullitions which proceed from the state of
the blood whilst the fœtus is confined in the womb, yet they are not
given in vain, as they are generally characteristic of the disposition
and temper of those that bear them; and it is also proved by daily
experience, that from the shape, situation, and other circumstances,
they bear a strong analogy to the events which are to happen to a
person in future life. but before i presume to give any directions
to those who are to form the prognostic, who are desirous to be duly
enabled to pronounce an infallible judgment, i shall, in the first
place, teach you herein the common prognostications by moles found
in the various parts of the body, according to the doctrine of the
ancients. and, first, it is essentially necessary to know the size
of the mole, its color, whether it be perfectly round, oblong, or
angular; because each of these will add to or diminish the force of the
indication. the larger the mole, the greater will be the prosperity or
adversity of the person; the smaller the mole, the less will be his
good or evil fate. if the mole is round, it indicates good; if oblong,
a moderate share of fortunate events; if angular, it gives a mixture
of good and evil; the deeper the color, the more it announces favor or
disgrace; the lighter, the less of either. if it is very hairy, much
misfortune  be expected; if but few long hairs grow upon it, it
denotes that your undertakings will be prosperous.

we shall further remark only, that moles of a middling size and color
are those which we are now going to speak of. the rest  be gathered
from what we have just above mentioned, but as it  frequently happen
that modesty will sometimes hinder persons from showing their moles,
you must depend upon their own representation of them for your opinion.


                        signification of moles.

in his dealings. it foreshows a comfortable acquisition of fortune,
with a good partner, and beautiful children, but some disagreeable
circumstances will happen about the age of thirty, which continue four

once, but that she will survive her husband.

                      signification of the nails.

broad nails. the person that hath the nails thus, is of gentle nature,
good, and pusillanimous, and a great fear to speak before great
persons, or those by whom they are in subjection; as also being guilty
of extreme bashfulness.

if about these nails there happens to be an excoriation of the flesh,
which is commonly called points—in these large nails it signifies the
party given to luxury, yet fearful, but usually given to excess.

when there is at the extremity a white mark, it signifies ruin through
negligence. the party has more honesty than subtlety.

white nails. he that hath the nails white and long, is sickly, and
subject to much infirmity by fevers; he is neat but not very strong,
because of his indispositions, much addicted to the company of women by
whom he will be greatly deceived.

narrow nails. the person with such nails, is desirous of attaining
knowledge in the sciences; but is never long at peace with his
neighbors. but if to narrowness they add some degree of length, the
person will be led away by ambitious propensities, always aiming at
things which he will be unable to obtain.

round nails. these declare a hasty person, yet good-natured and very
forgiving; a lover of knowledge, liberal sentiment, doing no one any
harm, and acting by his own principles, but too proud of his own
abilities.

long nails. when the nails are long, the person is of a good-natured
turn, but placing confidence in no man, being from his youth familiar
with duplicity, but not practising it, from his strict adherence to
virtue.

fleshy nails. this description of nail indicates an idler, loving to
sleep, eat, and drink; not delighting in bustle and busy life; one who
prefers a narrow income without industry, to one of opulence to be
acquired by activity and diligence.

little nails. little round nails discover a person to be obstinately
angry, seldom pleased, inclining to hate every one, as conceiving
himself superior to others, though without any reason.

pale or lead-colored nails. a melancholy person, one who through choice
leads a sedentary life, and would willingly give up all things for the
sake of study, and to improve in the learned and metaphysical branches
of philosophy.

red and spotted nails. choleric and martial, delighting in cruelty
and war; his chief pleasure being in plundering towns, where every
ferocious particle in human nature is glutted to satiety.

when you find any black spots upon the nails, they always signify evil,
as white ones are a token of good.




               fortune-telling by tea or coffee grounds.


to pour out the grounds of a tea or coffee cup.—pour the grounds of
coffee or tea into a white cup, shake them well about in it, so that
their particles  cover the surface of the whole cup; then reverse it
into the saucer, that all the superfluous parts  be drained, and the
figures required for fortune-telling be formed.

the person who acts as the fortune-teller, must always bend his or her
thoughts upon him or her who is to have their fortune told, and on
their rank in life, and profession, in order to give plausibility to
the predictions. it is not to be expected that upon taking up the cup,
the figures will be accurately represented as they are in reality, but
it will be quite sufficient if they bear some resemblance to any of the
emblems; and the more fertile the fancy is of the person that inspects
the cup, the more he or she will discover in it.

in other respects, every one who takes a pleasure in this amusement,
must be a judge under what circumstances he or she is to make changes
in point of time—speaking, just as it suits, in the present, the past,
or the future; in the same manner, their ingenuity ought to direct them
when to speak more or less pointedly with regard to sex.

the roads, or separate lines, indicate ways; if they are covered with
clouds, and, consequently, in the thick, they are said to be infallible
marks, either of many great or future reverses. but if they appear in
the clear and serene, are the surest token of some fortunate change
near at hand; encompassed with many points or dots, they signify either
a gain of money, or long life.

the ring signifies marriage; if a letter is near it, it denotes to the
person that has their fortune told, the initial of the name of the
party to be married. if the ring is in the clear, it portends happy and
lucrative friendship; if surrounded with clouds, the contrary. but if
the ring appear at the bottom of the cup, it forebodes the probability
of a separation.

the leaf of clover is, as well here as in common life, a lucky sign.
its different position in the cup alone makes the difference; because,
if it be on the top, it shows that the good fortune is not far distant;
but it is subject to delay, if it be in the middle or at the bottom.
should clouds surround it, it shows that many disagreeables will
attend the good fortune; in the clear, it prognosticates serene and
undisturbed happiness.

the anchor. the emblem of hope and commerce, implies successful
business carried on by water and by land, if on the bottom of the cup;
at the top and in the clear part, it shows constant love and fidelity;
but in thick and cloudy parts, it denotes inconstancy.

the serpent, always the emblem of falsehood and enmity, is likewise
here a general sign of an enemy. on the top or in the middle of the
cup, it promises to the consulting party that by his always acting
properly, his enemies will not be able to triumph over him; if in
the thick or cloudy part, he must watch his temper and actions very
carefully, to prevent great troubles.

the coffin. the emblem of death, prognosticates the same thing here, or
at least a long and tedious illness, if it be in the thick or turbid.
in the clear, it denotes long life; if in the thick, at the top of the
cup, it signifies a considerable estate likely to be made by cautious
industry.

the dog, being at all times the emblem of fidelity or envy, has also a
two-fold meaning here. at the top, in the clear, it signifies true and
faithful friends: if the image be surrounded with clouds and dashes, it
shows that some whom you take for your friends are not to be depended
on; but if the dog be at the bottom of the cup, take much care not to
excite any person to envy or jealousy, or you will have to dread the
effects of both.

the lily. if this emblem be at the top, or in the middle of the cup,
it signifies that the consulting party either has, or will have, a
good spouse; if it be at the bottom, it denotes anger. in the clear,
the lily further betokens a long and happy life; if clouded, or in the
thick, it portends trouble and vexations.

the cross, in general, predicts adversities; if it be at the top, and
in the clear, it indicates that the misfortunes of the party will soon
be at an end, or that he will, by careful conduct, easily get over
them; but if it appear in the middle, or at the bottom of the thick,
the party must expect many severe trials; if it appear with dots,
either in clear or thick, it promises recompense for sorrow.

the clouds. if they be more bright than dark, you  expect a good
result from your hopes; but if they are black, you  give it up.
surrounded with dots, they imply success in trade, if you are saving,
and not too venturesome; the brighter they are, the greater will be
your happiness.

the sun, is an emblem of the greatest luck and happiness, if in the
clear; but in the thick, it denotes a great deal of illness; surrounded
by dots or dashes, it foretells that, without much circumspection, an
alteration will soon take place.

the moon. if it appear in the clear, it denotes high honors; in the
dark or thick parts, it implies disappointment and sadness, which will,
however, pass without great prejudice. but if it be at the bottom of
the cup, the consulting party  expect, by industry and prudent
conduct, to be very fortunate.

the star denotes happiness, if in the clear, and at the top of the cup;
if clouded, or in the thick, it signifies long life, though exposed
to various troubles. if dots are about it, it foretells fortune and
respectability. several dots denote good children; surrounded by dots,
it predicts that, without good bringing up, they  cause you grief
and vexation.

mountains. if it present only one mountain, it indicates the favor
of people of rank; but several of them, especially in the thick, are
signs of powerful enemies; in the clear, they signify the contrary, or
friends in high life.

the letter. signifies both pleasant and unpleasant news. if this emblem
is in the clear part, it denotes the speedy arrival of welcome news;
surrounded with dots, it announces the arrival of a remittance of
money; but hemmed in by clouds, it forebodes some melancholy or bad
tidings, a loss, or some other accident; if it be in the clear, and
accompanied by a heart, lovers  expect a favorable letter; but in
the thick it denotes the contrary.

the tree. one tree only is indicative of good health; a group of trees
in the clear part, betokens misfortunes, but which  be avoided by
carefulness and industrious habits; several trees, wide apart, promise
that your wishes will be accomplished; if they be encompassed by
dashes, it is a token that your fortune is in its blossom, and requires
only your own care and prudence to bring it to maturity; if the trees
be accompanied by dots, it is a sign of riches.

the child. in the clear part it bespeaks innocent intercourse between
the consulter and another person; in the thick part it signifies
crosses in love matters, and requires your utmost care to prevent great
expenses; and a family without means of support.

the woman. signifies much joy in general. if in the clear, this emblem
shows very great happiness; but in the thick part it cautions against
jealousy. if dots surround the image, it shows children and wealth.

the pedestrian. denotes in general a merchant, good business, pleasant
news, or the recovery of lost things. it denotes to the female a kind
and industrious husband; it also signifies some engagement, and a short
journey.

the rider or horseman. denotes a letter, good news from abroad, a good
situation, or the like; it also foretells that a fortune is to be
obtained by care and industry.

the mouse. as this animal lives by stealth, it also is an emblem of
theft or robbery; if it be in the clear, it shows that your loss will
be easily prevented; but if in the thick, you must use your utmost
watchfulness.

the rose, or any other flower. usually indicates success in science or
art by study; if married, good children  be expected, and all the
happy fruits, if they have but a good education and good examples.

the heart. if it be in the clear, it signifies future pleasure. it
promises joy at receiving some money, if surrounded with dots. if a
ring or two hearts be together, it signifies that the party  expect
to be married; if a letter is perceptible near it, it shews the initial
of the person’s name.

the garden, wood, or bush. signifies a large company. in the clear
and with leaves, it indicates good friends; in the thick, encompassed
with streaks, or if without leaves, it is a token of the caprices of
fortune, and warns the consulting party to be cautious whom they take
for their friends.

the rod. predicts differences with people about matters relating to
legacies; in the thick, it denotes some affliction, which will require
your utmost care to avert.

the bird in general. in the clear, it signifies that the disagreeables
and troubles with which you will have to combat, will only be
surmounted by persevering in doing good; in the thick, it is a sign
of good living; also a speedy journey, or voyage, which, if there be
dashes, is likely to be to a distance.

fish in general. imply some lucky event by water, if in the clear,
which will either happen to the consulter, or be the means of improving
his affairs. if they are in the thick, the consulter  expect to fish
in troubled water. surrounded with dots, his destiny warns him to use
diligence, temperance and frugality.

the lion, or any ferocious beast. at the top, in the clear, it
signifies prosperity in your intercourse with people of quality. at the
bottom it warns the consulter to shun such intercourse and do nothing
to excite any person to envy his fortune.

worms. at the top, or in the middle of the cup, they denote good luck
in trade and in matrimony; below they warn you against rivals in
courtship, and against enviers in your trade and profession.

the style. if combined with an hour-glass and in the thick, it denotes
imminent dangers of all kinds; in love, disappointment; but in the
clear, it signifies that your sweetheart is faithful and affectionate
toward you, and that you are likely to live a long and happy life.




                  charms and magic prognostications.


herewith i give a few mysterious magic formulas and prognostications,
for the most part hitherto known only to wise old men and women, some
of which i have had confided to me by learned astrologers, and a few
were revealed to me by madame le normand, a celebrated fortune-teller,
in whose predictions the emperor napoleon put great confidence.


                       to prepare a love potion.

the following substances must be gathered in silence when the full moon
is in the heavens: three white rose leaves, three red rose leaves,
three forget-me-nots, and five blossoms of veronica.

all these things you must place in a vessel, then pour upon them five
hundred and ninety-five drops of clear easter water, and place the
vessel over the fire, or what is better still, over a spirit-lamp. this
mixture must be allowed to boil for exactly the sixteenth part of an
hour.

when it has boiled for the requisite length of time, remove it from the
fire, and pour it into a flask. cork it tightly, and seal it, and it
will keep for years without losing its virtue.

that this potion is certain in its effect i myself will guarantee,
for i have gained more than thirty hearts by its help. three drops
swallowed by the person whose love you desire, will suffice.


                     another means to compel love.

take a healthy, well-grown frog. place it in a box which has been
pierced all over with holes with a stout darning needle or gimlet. then
carry it in the evening twilight to a large ant-heap, place it in the
midst of the heap, taking care to observe perfect silence.

after the lapse of a week, repair to the ant-heap, take out the box,
and open it, when in place of the frog you will find nothing but a
skeleton. take this apart very carefully, and you will soon find among
the delicate bones a scale shaped like that of a fish and a hook. you
will need them both. the hook you must contrive to fasten in some way
or other into the clothes of the person whose affections you wish to
obtain, and if he or she has worn it, if it is only for a quarter of a
minute, he will be constrained to love you, and will continue to do so
until you give him or her a fillip with the scale.

this method is over three thousand years old, and it has been practised
by thirty-thousand of our ancestors with the most complete success.


            for a girl to ascertain if she will ever marry.

borrow a wedding-ring from a young married woman—the more recently she
has been married the better—and do not tell her, or let her suspect
your purpose; wear this ring on the third finger of your left hand at
least three hours after sunset before you retire to rest. when you are
ready to go to bed, take half a sheet of pure white paper, with no rule
marks or anything upon it, lay down the ring on the paper, and mark
round it so as to make a circle exactly its size: you then write within
the circle,  “with this ring i hope to wed:” write your name over the
top, and your age underneath; fold the paper with a three-cornered
love-letter fold, and put it under your pillow. before getting into
bed, suspend the ring by a hair of your head over the pillow so that it
will hang about six inches above your face. you will then dream of your
future husband if you are ever to marry. if you dream of several men,
the one whose appearance pleases you best will be the man. if you dream
of women or girls exclusively, you will never marry. sometimes it 
happen that your dream is confused, and you have no clear recollection
of it, or perhaps you  not dream at all, in which case you must
continue the charm, by keeping the paper under your pillow for three
nights; but the ring is not necessary after the first night.


                            the straw sign.

if you find a blade of straw lying in your chamber, you  expect
a visitor that same day. if there is one grain upon the straw, the
visitor will be a gentleman, if not, a lady.


                   the scissor or knife prognostic.

if a pair of scissors, a knife, or any other pointed instrument falls
accidentally from your hand, and sticks in the floor, so that it
remains upright, you  make every preparation for company, for be
assured they will not fail to come.


                           the cat portent.

when the cat licks and trims herself, it is a sign of visitors, but
this is probably known to most of my readers already.


                           sign of visitors.

finally, a fourth sign of approaching visitors is the crying of the
magpie. magpies, as is well known, are the most inquisitive creatures
upon the face of the earth. they fly from place to place, and listen
to everything. when they find out that any persons have concluded to
pay you a visit, they fly to you at full speed, and bring you the
news, for they are as chattering as they are inquisitive. they perch
themselves upon your house, or upon a tree which  stand near it, or
on the grass, and there sit and chatter until they think you must have
understood them. therefore, always give heed to these wise birds, for
it is well to know when you are to expect visitors.


                             the new moon.

on first seeing the new moon, if you happen to look at it over your
right shoulder, you  make a silent wish, and you will realize it.
if a girl thus observes the new moon, and desires to see her future
husband, she must repeat to herself (so as not to be heard by any one)
the following lines:

  new moon, new—pray let me see
  who my husband is to be:
        the color of his hair,
        the clothes he is to wear,
  and the happy day that he’ll wed me!

if she is to be married that year, she will positively see the man of
her choice before the wane of the full moon.


                        the key and book charm.

to find out the two first letters of a future wife’s or husband’s name,
take a small bible and the key of your front street-door, and having
opened to solomon’s songs, chap. viii., ver. 6 and 7, place the wards
of the key on those two verses, and let the bow of the key be about
an inch out of the top of the bible; then shut the book, and tie it
round with your garter, so as the key will not move, and the person
who wishes to know his or her future husband or wife’s signature, must
suspend the bible, by putting the fore-finger of the right hand under
the bow of the key, and the other person in like manner on the other
side of the bow of the key, who must repeat the following verses,
after the other person’s saying the alphabet, one letter to each time
repeating them.

[illustration: the key and book charm.]

it must be observed, that you mention to the person who repeats the
verses, before you begin, which you intend to try first, whether
surname or christian name, and take care to hold the bible steady; and
when you arrive at the appointed letter, the book will turn round under
your finger, and that you will find to be the first letter of your
intended’s name.

              solomon’s songs, chap. viii., ver. 6 and 7.

 "set me a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm; for love is
 strong as death, jealousy is cruel as the grave; the coals thereof are
 coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.

  “many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it; if
 a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would be
 utterly contemned.”


                              card charm.

draw all the face cards from the pack and put them into your stocking
on a friday night, placing the stocking under your pillow. you must
find out by the almanac the precise time the sun rises on saturday
morning, and at that moment draw a card. a king denotes a speedy
marriage; a queen means delay or celibacy; a jack is a gay seducer who
will give you trouble. diamonds are riches, hearts true love, spades
thrift, and clubs poverty.


                           the spider omen.

it is considered an ill omen when one sees a spider _in the morning_.
the earlier in the morning, and the larger the spider, the greater the
evil which threatens you. it is _within doors_, however, and chiefly
_in one’s own chamber_, that the spider has this signification—out of
doors they forebode no harm. the _wood spider_ especially, is not much
to be dreaded; what i have said above refers particularly to the _house
spider_. never, on any account, kill a wood spider. by such an act you
would only draw upon yourself the hatred of the whole race of witches,
and sooner or later you would suffer from it.

when found _in the evening_, a spider signifies good luck. the smaller
the spider, the greater the good fortune. i will here teach you the
following rhyme:

     “matin, chagrin,
    soir, espoir.”

little spiders have much less evil in them than the others, and those
called daddy-long-legs are always messengers of good luck.


                           the string token.

if your shoe-tie or apron string breaks, your sweetheart is thinking of
you.


                   sign when your right ear tingles.

if your _right ear_ tingles, some one is speaking _well_ of you, if
the _left ear_ tingles, some one is speaking _ill_ of you. to find
out who this some one is, you must call out aloud the names of your
acquaintance, one after another. the name at which the tingling ceases
is the name of the person.


                      sign when tour nose itches.

if your nose itches early in the morning, you will on that very day
hear a piece of news.


                             strange bed.

lay under your pillow a prayer-book, opened at the matrimonial service,
bound round with the garters you wore that day, and a sprig of myrtle
on the page that says  “_with this ring i thee wed_,” and your dream
will be ominous, and you will have your fortune as well told as if you
had paid a dollar to an astrologer.


                         the sign of a sneeze.

if any one tells you anything, and you are shortly after obliged to
sneeze, you  be sure that what was told you is true.


                            the death-tick.

if you hear a wood-tick or death-watch ticking anywhere in the house,
you must try to get rid of it as soon as possible, or you will speedily
hear of a death which will greatly afflict you.


                             the cricket.

if there is a cricket in the house, be careful on no account to disturb
it. think of dickens’ _cricket on the hearth_.


                          an omen of riches.

when an _ant-heap_ gathers in your house, it signifies _coming
wealth_—you , however, destroy the nest.


                         the frog prognostic.

if the first _frog_ that you see in the spring of the year is sitting
upon _dry ground_, it signifies that, during the same year, you will
shed as many tears as the frog would require to swim away in.


                           the candle token.

when a large red token forms in the flame of a candle-wick, it
signifies that the one who first sees it will soon receive a letter.


                           the star augury.

when you are out of doors on a starlit evening, and shooting stars
appear, turn your face upward to the stars, and utter in a whisper the
wish nearest your heart. if a star shoots while you do this, you  be
sure that the wish will be fulfilled.


                how to be sure of a partner at a dance.

when you wish to be sure of many partners at a dance or ball, let
a little brother or sister, or any other person _hold a thumb for
you_—that is, keep her hand closed like a fist for a quarter of an
hour, holding her _thumb_ between the _fore_ and _middle finger_, while
she thinks of you, and wishes you good luck. this proceeding has a
wonderful effect.


                           the bride’s omen.

if you would have fair weather on your wedding day, you must always
faithfully feed the cats. it is true it is a common error when persons
think that it forebodes evil when it rains upon the bride _in her
bridal dress_. this is no evil omen, but the contrary. but, above all
things, let her be careful not to allow her _shoes to get wet_. if my
young readers would take the trouble to read frederika bremer’s work
called  “the house,” they would find in it a confirmation of this
warning.


        to know if a woman with child will have a girl or boy.

write the proper names of the father and the mother, and of the month
she conceived with child, and likewise adding all the numbers of those
letters together, divide them by seven; and then, if the remainder be
even, it will be a girl, if uneven, it will be a boy.


                            the crow sign.

if you wish to know how matters will go with you during the year, you
must take good heed of the first _crow_ that you see in the spring. if,
when you first see it, it is _flying_, it signifies that you will take
a journey that will be longer or shorter, according to the distance
which the bird flies before it alights. it  also signify a complete
_change of abode_, perhaps by a wedding. if you first see the bird
_sitting_, you will remain at home; if _cawing_, much that you do not
think of will happen to you; if upon _one leg_, fortune will not smile
upon you.


                          the rabbit augury.

if, when in the open field, or upon the highroad, a _rabbit runs across
your path_, it signifies that something _unpleasant_ will happen to you.


                      the sheep and swine token.

if you are going to pay a visit, and you meet with _sheep_, you will be
very _welcome_; but if you meet with _swine_, you will be _unwelcome_.


                      a charm against nightmare.

if you wish to be secure against the nightmare in your sleep, place
your shoes side by side upon the floor, at the foot of the bed, so
that the toes will point _not_ toward the bed, but in the contrary
direction, as if they were _going from it_.


                     what a spider web foretells.

if you are walking with a young man at a time when the so-called
gossamer, those snow-white spider’s threads, are floating about in the
air, and one of these delicate fibrous veils sweeps by, _and forms
a band between you and him_, it is a sign that feelings of a tender
nature will some day bind you to each other.


                       how to get a sweetheart.

if a thick, long spider’s web hangs anywhere from the ceiling, you must
sweep it down as soon as possible, for it signifies a _suitor_, and the
one that gets the web will have him.


                 what a prick in the finger signifies.

if you are sewing upon a new dress, apron, &c., &c., and you prick your
finger with the needle so as to bring blood, it is a sign that when you
first wear the garment you will receive many kisses.


                             easter water.

in speaking of a love potion, i made mention of _easter water_; many
of my readers have, i suppose, never heard of this singular kind of
water. i will explain it to you. it is water which is drawn from the
river upon easter morning, before the sun has shone upon it. to obtain
it, therefore, you must rise on easter morning while it is still
quite dark, take your way to the river in silence, fill your pitcher
in silence, and then make your way home in silence, without looking
behind you. you  then go to bed again and have your sleep out. this
easter water has this peculiarity: _it will keep sweet throughout
the whole year_. you can, therefore, fill as many bottles with it as
you please, cork them tightly, and lay them away. besides its use in
the above-named love potion, it is beneficial in various maladies,
especially in diseases of the eye, and, in addition to this, it is an
approved cosmetic.


                            the rye charm.

if you would have bread and cake in plenty during the whole year, hang
a full sheaf of rye and a full sheaf of wheat upon a pole outside the
door, on christmas morning, so that the birds  come and feed from it.


       numerous methods of telling fortunes on new year’s eye.

the evening which of all others is the most adapted for witchery, is
new year’s eve. it is a very ill practice to spend this evening _at
a ball_, and it is an acknowledged fact that ill luck, more or less,
follows a person throughout the year, who has _danced the old year out
and the new year in_.

you should spend new year’s eve with a small circle of near and dear
friends, around a punch-bowl, while you seek to inquire what the future
has in store for you. in the first place this  be done with _melted
lead or wax_. some of you, perhaps, are acquainted with this method of
inquiring of the future, yet there  be many among your number who
are still ignorant of it. now, as it is of the highest interest in the
world that these should know the process, i will here give, for their
benefit, a short explanation of it, which the others  skip over.


                        the lead and wax spell.

take a good-sized piece of lead or wax, (the former is better,) place
it in a melting-ladle, and dissolve it over the coals, or over a
spirit-lamp, into which you have poured a little alcohol. you must then
take a vessel full of water, (a bowl is best, that is not too deep nor
too shallow,) and pour into it the lead or wax, and from the various
figures which it forms in the water you endeavor to tell your fortune.


                           the saucer charm.

the following is another method: you take four saucers; in one you
put a _ring_, in another a _sprig of myrtle_, in the third a _piece
of money_, and in the fourth _nothing_. the individuals composing
the company must now walk around the table, blindfold, one after the
other, and choose one of the saucers, which, in the mean time, have
been changed as to place. those among the company who choose the ring,
will be _betrothed_ in the course of the year; _myrtle_ signifies
wedlock, the _piece of money wealth_, the _empty saucer_ no change of
circumstances.


  how to tell the first letter of your future wife or husband’s name.

if you wish to know the letter with which your future wife or husband’s
name commences, write all the letters of the alphabet, separately, upon
small pieces of paper, put these pieces in a box, and draw one out
blindfold.

all this  be done before twelve o’clock. exactly at the stroke of
midnight, however, you can summon up your future husband or wife, and
behold his or her image _up the chimney_.


                           the candle spell.

the following is another method: take _two candles_, go a little
before twelve o’clock into an adjoining chamber—no one on any account
must follow you—place yourself before the _mirror_, and exactly as it
strikes _twelve_, call out your own name in full, _three times_. when
the last sound has died away, you will see in the glass your future
husband looking over your shoulder.

the company  not remain together after twelve o’clock. when the old
year is out and the new year in, you must embrace, and kiss each other,
and then go home. you must not yet go to bed, however, but must first
devote an hour to solitude, to reflect upon all which the past year has
brought with it, and to commit to writing the chief occurrences, as
well as the state of your minds. it would be well to keep a book for
this purpose, in which you should read and write only on a new-year’s
eve, and at other times keep carefully stored away. i have always done
this, and i can assure you, that it is with a feeling of sad, sweet
interest, that i now read, each new-year’s eve, of the eighty-nine
years of my life.


                        the nutshell witchery.

among the witcheries which you  perform on a new-year’s eve, there
is one to which i have not alluded. each person of the company, to wit,
takes a _nutshell_, and, after lighting a _wax taper_, places it in the
shell. a basin of water is then brought. you now place the nutshells,
with the burning tapers in them, in the basin. some will incline toward
each other as they float along, others will repel each other, until, at
last, all are extinguished or sunk. what conclusions in reference to
the future, are to be drawn from the various movements of these tiny
magic skiffs, your own quick wits will tell you.


                           the bridge omen.

after you have gone home, and have devoted an hour to the solitary task
which i counselled you (see candle spell), take a _glass of water_,
cut a small _chip of wood_, and lay it crosswise upon the glass, so
that it stretches like a bridge, from one end to the opposite one. then
place this glass under your bed. the consequence will be that you will
dream during the night that you are walking over a bridge, and that you
fall into the water. a gentleman, however, appears and rescues you.
this same gentleman, whom you will see very distinctly, be careful to
remember, for he is your future husband. a gentleman can make the same
experiment, and he will dream the same thing, with the difference only,
that it is a lady who rescues him, and she is to be his future wife.


                            the hair spell.

if you wish any person to think of you, pluck a hair from your head,
and blow it out into the air toward that quarter of the heavens in
which the person lives, while, at the same time, you call out the name
of this person _three times_, at the top of your voice. during this you
must be entirely alone, and must have thought intently upon the person
for, at least, a quarter of an hour beforehand. at the same instant he
will experience a strange unearthly shudder or thrill, and his thoughts
will turn irresistibly toward you.


                     sign when you wet your apron.

when you are washing, if you are apt _to wet your apron_ a great deal,
it is a sign that your future husband will be a tippler. take good heed
therefore!


                            the nail token.

if a person has nails that are all bitten to pieces, and gnawed close
to the quick, it signifies an evil, malicious character, and you have
every reason in the world to be on your guard in your intercourse with
such a person.




  how to determine the lucky and the unlucky days of any month in the
                                 year.


ascertain from the almanac the day on which a full moon occurs, and
count the number of days from that to the end of the month: you then
multiply the number of days in the month by the number ascertained as
above, and the total will give you the lucky days (subject to a further
test hereafter explained), which must be reckoned this wise: if the
total happens to be, say 516, the lucky days of that month would be
the 5th and 16th, and if it should be 561, the days are the same, for
you must always transpose the figures, when they will work together.
suppose that instead of 516, the total should be 399; as neither of
these figures can be paired, the lucky days from that total are the
3d and 9th, and the 9th would be considered doubly lucky, if no tests
worked to the contrary.

the unlucky days are determined in precisely the same manner, by
multiplying the number of days in the month by the number which had
passed previous to a full moon.

after working out your list of lucky days, in the manner above
described, you must then test them, in order to be sure that there are
no opposing influences. you can do this by calculating the unlucky
days. should you find that any day of the month which was designated as
lucky came also in the list of unlucky days, the latter preponderates,
and you must strike it from the lucky list.

this plan of demonstrating lucky and unlucky days is very ancient,
and has been tested to such an extent that it is considered accurate
by most astrologers. in old times, before the mass of the people
understood much about figures, the professional fortune-tellers
demanded a large fee for casting the lucky days of any month, which
they accomplished in the manner above described.

lucky marriage days for girls were cast in the same manner, except
that the age of the girl was used as the multiplicator, or multiplier,
instead of the number of days in the month. the result was determined
similarly, and also by a test of the unlucky days. thus, if a girl
is 18 years old, and thinks of marrying in , she takes up an
almanac and ascertains the day of the full moon in that month. it
occurs on the 24th, and there are 31 days in the month: this leaves 7
for the multiplier. she multiplies this by her age, 18, and the result
is 106, which shows the lucky days in that month for her to marry are
the 10th and 6th, unless they are destroyed by the test, which is
determined as follows: there are 23 days before the 24th, and she must
multiply 23 by 18, which gives 414, and shows that the 4th and 14th are
the only unlucky days for her to marry; and as they do not conflict
with the lucky days, the 6th and 10th  be considered as genuine
lucky days for that month, reckoning the moon to have fulled on the
24th. in determining her age, she should reckon any period over half a
year a full year.




                           the divining rod:

    or, how to tell where to dig for water and all kinds of metals.


so early as agricola, a celebrated conjuror who lived in ancient times,
the divining rod was in much request, and has obtained great credit
for its discovering where to dig for metals and springs of water; for
some years past its reputation has been upon the decline, but lately it
has been revived, and with great success, as i have myself found from
numerous experiments that its effects are more than imagination, and
to enable others to do the like, i have laid down some short rules, as
follows:

directions for choosing rods. the hazel and willow rods, i have by
experience found, will actually answer with all persons who are in a
good state of health, if they are used with moderation, and at some
distance of time, after meals, when the operator is in good spirits.
the hazel, willow, and elm are all attracted by springs of water. some
persons have the virtue intermittently; the rod in their hands will
attract one half hour, and repel the next. the rod is attracted by
water, all metals, coals, amber, and lime-stone, but with different
degrees of strength.

the best rods are those from the hazel, or nut-tree, as they are
pliant and rough, and are best cut in the winter months; a shoot that
terminates equally forked is to be preferred, (_see fig. 1_,) about two
feet and a half long; but as such a fork is rarely to be met with, two
single ones of a length, and size  be tied together with thread, and
they will answer as well as the others. (_see fig. 2._)

[illustration:  fig. 1.       fig. 2.]

the most convenient and handy method of holding the rod is with the
palms of the hands turned upward, and the two ends of the rod coming
outward; the palms should be held horizontally as nearly as possible;
the part of the rod in the hands ought to be straight, and not bent
either backward or forward; the upper part of the arm should be kept
pretty close to the sides, and the elbows resting on them, the lower
part of the arm making nearly a right angle with the upper, though
rather a little more acute; the rod ought to be so held that, in its
working, the sides  move clear of the little fingers. the position
of the rod, when properly held, is much like the following figure,
(_see fig. 3_,) where the distance between the four downward lines is
the part supposed to be held in the hand.

[illustration: fig. 3.]

the best manner of carrying the rod is with the end prolaided in an
angle of about eighty degrees from the horizon, as by this method of
carrying, the repulsion is more plainly perceived than if it was held
perpendicularly. but after all the directions that can be given, the
adroit use of it can only be attained by practice. it is necessary that
the grasp should be steady, for if, when the rod is going, there should
be the least succession or counteraction in the hands, though ever
so small, it will greatly impair, and generally totally prevent its
activity, which is not to be done by the mere strength of the grasp,
for provided this be steady, no strength can stop it.

as soon as the person’s foremost foot comes near the attracting body,
the end of the rod is repelled toward the face. (_see fig. 4._) then
open the hands a little, replace the rod, and approach nearer, and the
repulsion will be continued until the foot is on or over the attracting
body. when this is the case, the rod will first be repelled a little,
viz., two or three inches, and then be attracted toward it.

[illustration: fig. 4.]

when it hath been drawn down, it must not be thrown back without
opening the hands, a fresh grasp being necessary to every attraction,
but the least opening of the hand is sufficient. as long as the person
stands over the attracting body, the rod continues to be attracted,
but as soon as the fore foot is beyond it, then the rod is drawn down
backward to the face. metals have different degrees of attraction:
gold is strongest, next copper, then iron, silver, tin, lead, bones,
coals, springs of water and lime-stone. to make common experiments,
set the foot on a piece or coin of any of these metals, having the rod
in your hands as before directed. in using the rod to discover springs
and metals, let the person hold the rod as already directed, and then
advancing north or south with a slow pace, just one foot before the
other, at first the rod  be repelled, but as the person advances
slowly, and comes over the spring, or vein of ore, the rod will be
strongly attracted. the divining rod is sometimes called _divina
virgula_, and sometimes _the luck rod_.

               signification or language of the flowers.


no book on fortune-telling and dreams would be complete without the
signification of the flowers. if we dream of, or have those smiles of
nature given to us, we should at once consult the language of flora and
ascertain what our dream or present signifies.

it is no new thing to attach a sentiment or meaning to each flower.
in eastern lands flowers have a language which all understand. it is
that  “still small voice” which is powerful on account of its silence.
it is one of the chief amusements of the greek girls to drop these
symbols of their esteem or scorn upon the various passengers who pass
their latticed windows, and the traveller can read upon egyptian rocks
accounts of the conquests of that ancient people recorded by foreign
plants. accompanying, we give a complete dictionary of the meaning of

 sut lovingood. yarns spun by  “a nat’ral born durn’d fool.” warped
 and wove for public wear by george w. harris. illustrated with
 eight fine full page engravings from designs by howard. it would be
 difficult, we think, to cram a larger amount of pungent humor into 300
 pages than will be found in this really funny book. the preface and
 dedication are models of sly simplicity, and the 24 sketches which
 follow are among the best specimens of broad burlesque to which the
 genius of the ludicrous, for which the southwest is so distinguished,
 has yet given birth.
