preface.


settled from remote times in the little town of leigh, in essex, at the
mouth of the thames, the family of haddock, we  be sure, took early
to the sea, as was befitting their name. there are traces of haddocks
of leigh to be found as far back as edward the third’s days; but we
need not search for earlier generations than those which sprang from
richard haddock, a captain in the parliamentary navy. that the family
had followed the sea from father to son in bygone times, and had so
established a tradition to be observed by their descendants, might be
argued from the regularity with which the haddocks of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries served in the navy for upwards of a hundred
years. this regularity is only to be equalled by that with which they
named their children richard, to the perpetual confusion of their
biographers.

captain richard haddock, to whom reference has been made above, served
under the commonwealth. in  we find him in command of the ship
victory, and in  he received a reward of £40 for good service.
he died in  at the age of 79. his eldest son william, also a
parliamentary captain, commanded the ship america in , and the
hannibal in . he survived his father only seven years, dying in
, aged 60. captain richard haddock had another son, richard, who
was probably a good deal younger than his brother. he served with
distinction in the dutch war in ;[1] and was in all probability the
father of william haddock whom the family papers show to have been a
lieutenant in the cornwall in -, and who commanded a ship in
the action off cape passaro in  (p. 54) and died in .

william haddock, the parliamentary captain, had at least four
sons: richard, andrew, joseph, and william. richard will be
noticed presently. andrew is mentioned in the first letter of this
correspondence. william was at sea with his brother richard in 
and . joseph was a lieutenant in the lion in , and in the
royal charles in , and served in the dutch war in those years;
and afterwards held a command in the east indies, whence he wrote an
interesting letter here printed (p. 37). richard haddock was born about
the year , and must have entered the service at an early age;
for in , when the present correspondence begins, he was already
a captain in command of the dragon frigate, which formed part of the
squadron cruising off dunkirk. in  he was captain of the portland;
but from  to  he appears to have temporarily left the navy
and engaged in trading to the mediterranean. on the breaking out of
the dutch war, however, he was made captain of the royal james, the
ship on which the ill-starred earl of sandwich hoisted his flag in
the battle of southwold bay. he was one of the few officers of that
vessel who survived the day, though he did not escape unwounded. he
next commanded the lion; but early in  he was appointed to the
royal charles, prince rupert’s ship, and within a few weeks followed
the prince into the royal sovereign, when the bad qualities of the
former ship in action became evident. in  of the same year he was
made commissioner of the navy; and on the 3rd of , , he was
knighted. in  he was appointed to the command of the duke and to
the chief command of ships of war in the thames and narrow seas; and
in the next year became first commissioner of the victualling office.
after the revolution he was named comptroller of the navy, which office
he continued to hold till his death, and received a pension of £500 a
year. he was one of the joint commanders-in-chief of the fleet in the
expedition to ireland in . he died on the 26th of , , in
his eighty-sixth year, and was buried in his native town of leigh.

sir richard represented the borough of shoreham in the parliament of
-. he was twice married, his first wife being named lydia,
probably a member of the family of stevens, which was settled at leigh.
the maiden name of his second wife elizabeth is unknown. he probably
married her not earlier than , when she was about twenty years of
age, the inscription on her tomb recording her death in , at the
age of 59.

sir richard appears to have had at the least six children, three sons
and three daughters. the sons were richard, william, and nicholas.
of the daughters the name of only one, elizabeth, has survived, who
married john clarke, of blake hall in bobbingworth, co. essex. another
daughter married a lydell. the third daughter died unmarried. william,
apparently the second son, died young. richard and nicholas both
entered the navy.

richard, the eldest son, was, in , fifth lieutenant of the duchess,
and was present at the battle of la hogue. he afterwards served in the
london, and in  was in command of the rye. at the beginning of
 he received his commission as captain of the reserve, and in the
following year succeeded to the swallow. in the latter ship he served
with sir george rooke in the mediterranean. but in  he had the
misfortune to be surprised by the french when convoying the archangel
merchant fleet and to lose fifteen ships; and, although appointed to
the resolution early in the following year, he seems to have soon
retired from active service. in , however, he re-appears as
comptroller of the navy, and held the post for fifteen years, dying at
an advanced age in . from the entries in leigh parish registers it
seems that he was married thrice and had issue, none of whom, however,
survived him many years.

of nicholas, the youngest son of sir richard haddock, we first catch
sight in the following pages (p. 43) as distinguishing himself at vigo
in , and serving in spain in . in the following year, on the
7th , he received the command of the new ship ludlow castle, being
not yet twenty years old. at the battle of cape passaro he fought his
ship, the grafton, with great gallantry; and indeed at all times proved
himself a very skilful and dashing officer. he rose eventually to the
rank of admiral of the blue, and commanded the squadron sent into the
mediterranean to overawe the spaniards in -. he returned to
england invalided and did not long survive, dying in , aged 60.

about the year  he purchased wrotham place, in kent, where he
occasionally lived. he left three sons: nicholas, richard, and charles.
the first died in ; richard served in the navy; charles was still
living at wrotham in .

here the male line of the haddocks fails; and it is not necessary to
follow the family history further. a pedigree, which  be found
useful, is appended.[2]

       *       *       *       *       *

it will be seen that the letters and papers here printed belonged, for
the most part, to sir richard haddock. his long life enabled him to
embrace four adult generations in his correspondence. the collection
of documents from which they have been selected was purchased by the
trustees of the british museum in , and now forms the egerton mss.
-.

it is to be regretted that the correspondence is so comparatively
scanty, for no doubt at one time the collection was a good deal larger.
from nichols’s _literary anecdotes_ (vol. v. p. 376) we know that the
haddock papers were placed in the hands of captain william locker,
the lieutenant-governor of greenwich hospital, who contemplated a
publication of naval biography which was carried out by charnock in his
_biographia navalis_ from the same materials. there is also evidence
among the papers themselves, in the form of a letter written by charles
haddock in , to show that they were placed in locker’s hands. the
fate of borrowed books and papers is a mournful one.

but, few as they are, a selection from the haddock papers has been
thought worthy to appear in print. as specimens of the letter-writing
of a seafaring family of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
the letters have a value of their own, even apart from the personal
interest which they inspire as the record of long and honourable
service.

captain richard haddock[a] to his father.

                   dragon frigᵗ in the downes, this 30ᵗʰ , aᵒ .

honᵈ father,

sir, these i hope will congratulate yoʳ safe arrivall at leghorne, wᶜʰ
god graunt  be with yoʳ health and well fare, for the continuation
whereof i shall ever pray.

i cannot yet forgett my unhapynes yᵗ soe short a tyme and small
distance hindred me the inioymᵗ of seeing yoᵘ before you gote out yᵉ
channell, seeing i made it my aime and bussines to performe it, but
pleased god to frustrate me of my intended hapynes. i hope yᵗ our next
interview  be with the greater ioy and comfort. indeed, when i
returned to dover, which was the sonday following yoʳ departure, i was
not a little greived when major genˡˡ kelsey[b] tould me yᵉ unwellcome
news of yoʳ being past by; and himselfe was very sory when i gave him
an accᵗ yᵗ i mett yoᵘ not, and tould me, if i had in yᵉ least desired
not to have gone for zeinhead, he would have ordered an other ship in
oʳ roome. i was very thankfull for his respect he exprest towards yoᵘ,
but i knew not before yᵗ i might be soe bould wᵗʰ him as to desire such
a favor. yoᵘ saild hence yᵉ fryday evening; and satuarday, by 10 in yᵉ
forenoone, we were soe neare yᵉ head of beachy yᵗ noe shipp could or
did passe by us, but we spake wᵗʰ in hopes of meeting yoᵘ. surely the
wind blew the harder to deny me yᵗ hapynes. god in mercy goe alongst
with yoᵘ and preserve yoᵘ from the rage of unreasonable men. i shall
not be wanting, as i am bound in duty, to make it my earnest request to
god for yoʳ preservation. my wife, in good health, presents her humble
duty to yoᵘ, and hath ever since bine very sorrowfull she stayed not
behind to present her duty and respects to yoᵘ at yoʳ departure.

sir, litle of novelty ofers at present, only of great preparations for
yᵉ fitting out seavrall great shipps, as yᵉ resolution, naiesby, and
andrew, from portsmᵒ; yᵉ tryomph, victory, vantguard, and entrance,
from chatham. i cannot give you an accᵗ, yᵉ occasion or upon wᵗ designe
yᵉ shipps are prepared; only suppose it  be to be in a readynes
to defend our selves if any treachorus act should be ofered by the
hollander, who will have 70 saile men of warr out very sodainely, as
is certainely reported. i hope noe act of hostillity against us is
intended. we have iust cause to feare yᵉ worst; and i think, as farr as
i am able to aprehend, yoᵘ will have little occasion to trust or put
any confidence in them abroad. god send us peace at home and abroad;
but, if these faile us, peace wᵗʰ god will beare up our spirits in the
greatest dificulties yᵗ doe atend our earthly pilgrimage.

sir, my wife desires yoᵘ please, at yoʳ arrivall at venᵃ, to buy for
her a foiled stone of the measure i conseave was given by her sisters
to brother andrew at leigh; as alsoe a pott ketle and 2 stue panns, one
lesser than the other; as alsoe a jarr from leghorne, with wᵗ other
things nessesary for a howse, to yᵉ value of £3 in fower pound in all,
which shall be thankfully repayed. i intend to wright yoᵘ to venᵃ,
when [i] conseave you  ataine thither, and what ofers shall not be
wanting of advizeing yoᵘ.

my lord protector hath denyed yᵉ governmᵗ of the comonwealth under yᵉ
title of king,[c] and since, its established to him in the title he now
beares.[d]

i have not heard from home since yoʳ departure. my intire love with
my wives remembred to our 3 brothers wᵗʰ all oʳ freinds on bord yoᵘ.

presented to yoʳ self, i remayne,

yoᵘ, to subscribe herselfe yoʳ lo. daughter till death,

honᵈ father,

sʳ, my most humble duty wᵗʰ bro. wms. presented unto you wᵗʰ oʳ intire
loves to oʳ loveing brothers and freinds wᵗʰ you. these only serve to
advize yoᵘ of our wellfare, hopeing and earnestly praying to the lord
that yᵉ like good health atends you yᵗ, blessed be god, we injoy.
these i hope will find yoᵘ safe arrived at leghorne. my last from the

command of this squadron that now lyes wᵗʰ us before this place.[a]
since oʳ arrivall heere, wᶜʰ is 14 dayes since, not anything of action
hath ofered worth yoʳ advice; the good we doe heere is only to keepe
there men of warr in yᵗ are in, and prevent those comeing in wᵗʰ there
prisses yᵗ are abroad. but they want not harbours in holland to secure
them and wᵗ they ketch from us. i conseave yoᵘ want not letters of
caution from yoʳ owners to be carefull of trusting the hollanders.
i feare they will prove treacherous to there ingagemᵗˢ wᵗʰ us in
the peace agreed betwixt us. they are almost ready to saile wᵗʰ 50
or upward men of warr, besides 16 saile now in or channell. my lord
protector is not wanting to prevent there treacherous actions, if any
intended against us. i conseave in 14 dayes we  have upwards of 40
saile, considerable men of warr, in the downes, to answer any atempt
 be ofered by them; and doe beleive both we and the squadron before
ostend  be called of, as soone as we have any intelligence of there
redynes to saile.

all oʳ freinds in england, i heare, are in health. my wife still at

honᵈ father,

sʳ, my most humble duty presented unto yoᵘ wᵗʰ my deare mother,
grandfather, and grandmᵒ, wᵗʰ my loveing saluts to my wife, broˢ,
sisters, and freinds. my last, of 18 instant, i sent by my broʳ wm.,
whome i gave leave to goe to london; wᶜʰ hope is safely arrived with
you. since wᶜʰ, litle of acction here in these parts. the 21 instant,
about midnight, heere escaped out a small pickeron of 4 or 6 guns
out this haboʳ, notwᵗʰstanding our vigilancy and indeavors for his
surprizall, haveing oʳ boates in wᵗʰ the shore and a small frigᵗ, who
gave him chase and fired seavrall guns at him; but the darknes of the
night prevented there long keepeing sight of him, and, notwᵗʰstanding
they made after him to the best of there understanding, yet he got
away and noe sight of him at day light. last saturday heere went from
mardike marshall d’aumon, duke of bouligne,[a] wᵗʰ 13 hundred french
souldiers, imbarqued in seaverall vessells, and gone to oastend, before
wᶜʰ place they arrived that night wᵗʰ the vice admirall.[b]

if the intelligence given me be true, we shall see a sodaine alteration
in flaunders. its said yᵗ, for a considerable summe of mony, the towne
of ostend is to be delivered up to yᵉ king of fraunce by the governor
and inhabitants of sᵈ place, they being in such a sad condition by
reasone of the extreame burden yᵗ lyes upon them.

for security of performance there is a considerable man, who hath
confirmed the accord wᵗʰ the k. of fraunce, now wᵗʰ marshall d’aumon,
that belongs to ostend, who hath ingaged his life for performance. i
pray god they faile not in there undertakeings; and, although treachery
be hateful and odious throughout the world, yet doubtles ’twill prove
hapye for our poore traders when such a considerable place as yᵗ is, a
neast of roages, shall be routed. if it proves efectuall, farwell most
pᵗˢ of flaunders this sumer.

sʳ, please to keepe this intelligence to yoʳ selfe, least it should
come from me, being privately advized me. i hope, when our victualling
is out, we shall come over to tallow; wᶜʰ god graunt, that i  not
fayle of my earnest desire of seeing you before you goe forth. i
intend sodaynly to send to the vice admirall to know where we shall be
disposed by him or otherwise from the comissʳˢ of admiralty. sʳ, i have
not other at present. wᵗʰ my humble request to yᵉ allmighty for yoʳ
preservation, i remayne

i sent to the vice admirall to desire he would order us into the river

right honᵇˡᵉ,

yours of 8th instant, wᵗʰ his r. highnesse order inclosed, i received
this afternoone; wᶜʰ shall put in execution to morrow morning, wind and
weather permiting. sonday last, in compᵃ wᵗʰ the adventure and a fire
ship, we sayled out of oasely bay through the slade way,[c] intending
for the north forland, and soe unto the downes, in search of our
fleet. about noone we gote sight of the forland, and within one hower
after we espied a fleet of shipps on the back of the goodwin sand, wᶜʰ
we deemed to be our fleet; but, standing wᵗʰ them, we found them to be
the dutch fleet, consisting of 70 in 75 sayle. two ships of the fleet
makeing us bore downe wᵗʰ us, and presantly after two more followed
them. we stood away from them to the eastwards, towards a ship then to
leewards, wᶜʰ we suposed to be a hollander, but proved a sweed bound
for burdaix light; and, finding two of the men of warr spring there
luffs againe and only 2 bore downe wᵗʰ us, we clapt upon a wind and
stood towards them, haveing gote them about 5 or 6 miles to leewards
of yᵉ body of there fleet. but, when they came wᵗʰin neere shote of
us, they keept there wind, would not come neere to fight us, but kept
fireing guns to windwards and makeing a waft wᵗʰ there ensignes for
more assistance; whereupon 7 or 8 sayle more bore away wᵗʰ us. night
comeing on, we thought it not convenient to lye by for them, but stood
away for our owne coast, not being able to keep our lower tire of
guns out to windwards, and but 32 brˡˡˢ powder on bord. yesterday we
got into alborough bay, when i gave accᵗ to the comissʳ at harwᶜʰ by
an expresse from alborough of our proceedings, desireing him to send
the said letter to yoʳ honʳ, if he thought it convenient. i have now
recᵈ from harwᶜʰ an aditionall suply of sixty barills of powder. the

not be ready in 3 or 4 dayes. to conclud, sonday night proved such a
hard galle of wind yᵗ i iudge the dutch fleet either drove or bore
away towards there owne coast, for we saw them all under sayle before
twas dark. i shall not be wanting to give yoʳ honʳ an accᵗ of our

26. the 26 day, thursday, we sailed out yᵉ downes, yᵉ wind at west. we

sent his boats on bord to know yᵉ reason of itt. whilst they were in
dispute, we, comeing in shote, fired at yᵉ admˡˡˢ flagg alsoe, and
presantly after they sent up a man to topmasthead and struck the flagg,
wᶜʰ his vice and reare admˡˡ did the like. then we bore under his lee

came and lay on his weather quarters. there flaggs hang as a waft for
about ½ an hower, and afterwards furld them; the admˡˡ fired a gun
to lewards, filld, and stood away to yᵉ eᵗwards. we answerd him with

at yᵉ north forland. we doe our utmost endeavor to get to them, if
they have a mind to fight us. to yᵉ westwards of yᵉ downes they 
easely be wᵗʰ us; but we judge there designe is to ingage us amongst

my deare betty,

the 18th instant, wᶜʰ was satuarday last, i wrote the by one of the
yachts, and as thou advised. yᵉ next day we saw the dutch fleet. we
drew ours into a lyne of bataile, the french leading, we in the reare,
all prepared to fight, haveing stav’d and heft over bord all ours, and
i think all the cabins of the whole fleet. the hollanders stood over
for yᵉ flaunders banks and yᵉ weelings. about 7 at night we were up
wᵗʰ them in a lyne, as they lay in the same posture very orderly to
recᵉ us; but, finding it would have bine darke before we could have
well began with them, being about 4 or 5 miles to leewards of us, yᵉ
wind at w.s.w., we thought it not convenient to ingage them. yᵉ night
following, upon there tacking of, we tackt in yᵉ reare, yᵉ whole fleet
following to keep them to leewards of us, as we did yᵗ night by our
twice tacking againe. yesterday morning it proved a very thick fogge.
we wᵗʰ our division anchored, standing in wᵗʰ the banks of flaunders of
oostend. about 10 in yᵉ morning, upon cleareing up, we wayed anchor, yᵉ
dutch fleet 3 miles to leewards of us. we stood of and mett our fleet
standing in. yᵉ dutch stood of wᵗʰ us. this day it proved much wind,
that we could not fight them; whereupon we stood in to our shore n.w.,
and about ½ seas over we anchored all night. this morneing we saw yᵉ
fleet again. we stood of towards them, expecting they would have stood
wᵗʰ us; but they stood of intending to draw us over amongst those
shoulds, to fight them there. we keeping our wind, and they bearing
away, as we suposed, from yᵉ wind, we lost sight of them. it blowing
hard we tackt, and now come neare to sowle bay, where i supose we 
stay a day or two to watter our fleet.

this day came into us the katherine, princes, and advice, wᵗʰ 2 fire
ships more; soe yᵗ i supose we are neerer 90 then fowerscore men of
warr, upwards 25 fireships, amongst wᶜʰ my unckle r. h. is come. the
dutch fleet not soe many men of warr as we, i beleive, by 8 or 10
saile, many small vessells and fire ships. had it pleased god yesterday
to have given us faire weather, god assisting, we had given a good accᵗ
of oʳ actions; our men briske and brave and very ready and willing to
fight. the earle of bristow[a] on bord wᵗʰ us. i thinke a fourth part

take its fortune towards thee. being in hast, have not tyme to wright

my courage, but i have not yet tasted them. pray returne him my kind
thanks. i hope shall survive this warr to make him amends. my deare, i
should be glad to heare from the, but i know not how. i shall not be
wanting to give the a constant advice, as opertunity presents, of my
wellfare and our actions. youl excuse me to my loveing relations yᵗ i
wright none of them. at present it is fowle weather. am glad we gote

i am sory to heare poore sam lane was prest into yᵉ french victory, and

lye now neare the gallaper in expectation of us; we are very neere,
ready to waite on them. 2 or 3 days must not breake square wᵗʰ us; but
they are deceaved to think we intend to fight them amongst the sands.
i supose our martch wilbe over for yᵉ coast of holland into sea roome

leaveing us, 90 men of warr, 26 fire ships, many small vessells. i
supose the dutch daylie add to ther strength as well as wee. god
allmighty be our defence.

my deare, i am sory that my first letter from southold, wᶜʰ went by

days, and shall stay 3 or 4 longer. then we shall have wattered our
whole fleet for one month, and victualld compleat for 2 months, and
mand i beleive thoroughout yᵉ fleet, not 500 wanting. i rather think,
in a day or two longer, we  have  supernumeraryes. a very worthy

i hope all my loveing relations at rederif and wapping are in health,

copy of captain richard haddock’s[a] account, given his royal highness
the duke of york, of their engagement,  28th, , in the royal
james.

in obedience to your royal highness’s commands, i here humbly present
to your view a brief narrative of our actions on board the royal james,
the 28th  last past, as followeth:

upon signal from our scouts of the dutch fleet’s approach (betwixt 3
and 4, the wind e. by s.), we put our ships immediately into a fighting
posture, brought our cable to the capston, and heaft a peak of our
anchor, which, upon firing a gun and loosing foretop-sail of your royal
highness’s ship, we presently weighed, and afterwards lay kedging with
our headsails at the mast till our anchor was up; which done (steered
n.e. by n.), we made sail and stood off, with our signal abroad for
the squadron[b] to draw into their line of battle, which was done as
well as the short time we had would permit. but, finding myself one of
the weathermost ships, i bore to leeward till i had brought ourselves
in a line; the vice admiral and part of his division right a head, the
rear admˡ and his right astern; only two or three frigates to leeward,
and so near, one of them within call. the dutch squadron, van ghent,
attacked us in the body and rear very smartly, and let the van go ahead
sometime without engaging them, so far as i could perceive. we engaged
about an hour and an half very smartly. when the dutch found that they
could do no good on us with their men of war, they attacked us with
two fire ships, the first of which we fired with our shott, the second
disabled by shooting down his yards. before which time i had sent our
barge, by my lord’s[c] command, ahead to sir joseph jordaine,[d] to
tack, and with his division to weather the dutch that were upon us
and beat them down to leeward of us, and come to our assistance. our
pinnace i sent likewise astern (both coxswains living) to command our
ships to come to our assistance; which never returned, but were on
board several who endeavoured it but could not effect it.

about two hours after we engaged we were boarded athwart hawse by one
of their men of war, notwithstanding our endeavours to prevent him
by wearing our ship two or three points from the wind to have taken
him alongside. when he had been athwart our hawse some short time,
my lord would have had me boarded him with our men and taken him,
which i refused to do by giving him my reason that it would be very
disadvantageous to us: first, that i must have commanded our men from
our guns, having then i believe 300 men killed and wounded, and could
not expect but to lose 100 in taking him; secondly, had we so done,
we could not have cut him loose from us, by reason the tide of flood
bound him fast; and, thirdly, had we plyed our guns slowly by taking
away our men, we had given cause to the enemy to believe we had been
disabled, and consequently more of them would have boarded us, which
might possibly have overpressed us, and would have been more dishonour
to have lost her by that means than being at last burnt;--so that my
lord was satisfied with my reasons, and resolved we should cuff it out
to the last man, still in expectation of assistance.

about 10 o’clock van ghent himself, finding those his other flags could
do no good upon us, nor the party with them, came up with us himself,
we having lost the conduct of our ship. he ranged along our side, gave
us a smart volley of small shot and his broadside, which we returned to
him with our middle and lower tier, our upper guns almost all disabled,
the men killed at them. he passed ahead of us and brought his ship too
to leeward, and there lay till i was gone off the deck.

some short time after, sir joseph jordaine (our barge having been with
him and given him my lord’s commands) passed by us very unkindly to
windward, with how many followers of his division i remember not, and
took no notice at all of us; which made me call to mind his saying to
your royal highness, when he received his commission, that he would
stand betwixt you and danger; which i gave my lord account of, and did
beleive by his acting yourself might be, in his view, in greater danger
than we, which made my lord answer me: “we must do our best to defend
ourselves alone.”

about 12 o’clock i was shot in the foot with a small shot, i supposed
out of van ghent’s main top, which pressed me after a small time to go
down to be dressed. i gave my lord account of it, and resolved to go
up again as soon as was dressed. in the mean time, when i went off the
deck, sent up both sir charles[e] and lieutenant mayo[f] to stand by
my lord; and, as soon as i came down, remembring the flood was done,
sent up to my lord to desire him to command the ship to anchor by the
stern, which was immediately done; and, after we had brought up, the
ship athwart our hawse fell away, and being entangled with our rigging
our men boarded and took her, cut her loose from us, and, at my lord’s
command, returned all aboard again. upon which i, hearing the ship was
loose, sent up to my lord that the cable might be cut and the ship
brought to sail before the wind, and loose our mainsail; which was
presently done. then my lord sent me his thanks for my advice, and
withall doubted not but to save the ship. at that time the surgeon was
cutting off the shattered flesh and tendons of my toe; and immediately
after we were boarded by the fatal fire ship that burnt us.

                         on bord the r. charles, this 29th , ;
                                                7 leagues of oostend.

my dearest love,

these are to give the an accᵗ of god’s goodnes to me. i am very well
and in health, praised be his name therfore. yesterday, the 28th
instant (yᵉ same day twelve month they atacqued us in sowle bay), we
atacqued the dutch fleet, consisting of 74 or 76 men of warr and 20
fire ships, as the dutch prisoners informe us. we set upon them in
the schoon velt, the wind at w.n.wᵗ., but changed to yᵉ n.n.e. in the
bataile towards evening. we buoyed the outward banks wᵗʰ our smacks
and ketches, and had a smart brush with them from 12 at noone as long
as daylight lasted. the damage we have done them we certainly know
not. severall of ther ships we disabled, wᶜʰ we forced into leewards.
trump, whose squadron we ingaged wᵗʰ ours, shifted his ship once, if
not twice. what number of men we have lost in the fleet not yet know;
i believe not 500. in our ship not above 20, as i can learne; some
mortality wounded, others dismembred. amongst our dead men is poore
capt. wasey, who first lost his arme close to his shoulder, and about
6 howers after dyed of his wounds. my brother joseph very well; was
wᵗʰ me last night after yᵉ bataile. my unckle richard very well: he
hath burnt his ship; was faire to burne de rutter within his length,
when they shote his masts about his eares; for wᶜʰ indeavoured service
yᵉ prince[a] hath given him one hundred pounds, and gratified also
his oficers, &c. i supose we shall not atacque them in that place
againe. our greatest care was to keepe cleere of the sands in that
narrow hole. our ship, so tender with a saile that we fought wᵗʰ the
watter some tymes comeing into our lower tire of ports, wᶜʰ was very
disadvantagious, could not do that service intended by us.

there is severall capᵗˢ killed that we have already an account of;
i hope no more. capt. finch in the yorke, capt. tempest in the
sweepestakes, capt. fowles in the lyon; and capt. werden, in the
heneretta, mortality wounded.[b] we have severall of our ships
shattered, not above two disabled, and none, as i heare of, lost, but 2
or 2 fire ships burnt.

we ride now wᵗʰin 3 leagues of the dutch fleete; they ride in the place
we atacqued them in, and we in our former birth, only about 2 leagues
further of the shore. how soone we shall fight them againe cannot
resolve, but in yᵉ place they now ride i iudge we shall not atacque
them a second tyme. i beleive the prince  shift his ship and goe
into some other; but of yᵗ in my next.

i desire that thanks and prayes  be returned to almighty god for his
preservation of me. my humble duty to my deare mother; loving saluts
to my brothers and sisters, and all my deare relations. god in mercy
blesse and preserve them all, and send us a joyfull meeteing. wᵗʰ my
intire love and saluts to thee wᵗʰ my daughter and litle dickee, i
remaine

                                                       richard haddock.

we have a rumor that capt. trevanion[c] is killed, comdᵍ the
dreadnought; but i hope it is not true.

my deare betty,

i wrote the two dayes since of god’s goodnes to mee in oʳ late bataile.
i gave the accᵗ of capt. trevanions suposed to be killed, but he is
well; and allso capt. courtney,[a] wᶜʰ was reported to be killed, is
alive and well. capt. worden is since dead of his wounds.[b] we are
now shifting ships, goeing on bord the london; the reason i gave in my
last. sʳ jnᵒ harman[c] goes from the london into the sovraigne, and
capt. hayward[d] out ye sovraigne into this ship. it is no smal trouble
to me to part from this brave ship; her only fault is she is tender
sided, in all respects otherwayes the best ship in the world.

my deare, i am very well; my broʳ joseph and unckle richard likewise.
the prince in good health, and our fleet prepareing for another
incounter, if the dutch comes out. my deare, i am thyne till death,

my deare betty,

wee ride in sight of our neighbours the dutch, not above 3 in 4 leagues
distant. this morning they were under saile; we thought they would
have come of to us. we put ourselves in a posture to recᵉ them. they
have now the wind of us, being easterly; and  come out if they
please. this morning we have accᵗ from a good hand from oostend yᵗ
they sent in 6 or 7 disabled ships to flushing, two whereof sunck in
going in. they likewise sent on shore 400 or 500 wounded men, and, as
they advize from oostend, comᵈ was given not to speake of the fight at
flushing. so doe beleive, till they recrute ther strength, we shall not
heare of them; however, we are not wanting to prepare ourselves agᵗ
they come. the swiftsure is this day come to us; had like to have bine
snapt tuesday last by the amsterdam squadron yᵗ came into the schoon
velt tyme enough to fight.

i have but little else to write to thee. sʳ roger strickland sends his
hoy to deptford for watter; and these goe by sʳ ed. spragg’s yacht, who
caryes up one coll. hambliton into the river, who lost his legg on bord
us. pray lett me heare from thee by one or both of them. my humble duty
to my deare mother; love and saluts to all freinds in genˡˡ. wᵗʰ my
deare love to thy selfe, my daughter, and little richard, i remayne

thyne, till death us part,

20. this tuesday, at 3 in the morneing, being alaramed by seavrall
gunns from the eastwards, we fired a gunn and put out a light in the
mainetopmast shrowds, our signall of weighing, but did not weigh by
reason of the ebb tyde, the wind being at s.eᵗ. we had intelligence,
by a sloop, of 70 saile of hollanders seene on the back of yᵉ goodwin,
and wᵗʰout the sᵒ sands head; but proved to be, by our 2d intelligence
by the litle greyhound, a fleet of hamburghers of 26 saile only. this

watter, oostend spire steeples beareing s.e. by sᵒ, 5 leagues distant.
this evening we saw the dutch fleet, part of them; they rode in
schonvelt. our scout gave us accᵗ they were but 86 saile, the outside,
small and great. they wayed and turned up amongst yᵉ bancks towards the

of 35 men of warr, 13 fire ships, and 24 tendors ahead of us, to make
the onsett, and we wᵗʰ the whole fleet to have seconded them. but this
our intention was this day prevented by god almighty’s providence, the
wind bloweing very hard at s.w. and wᵗ.s.wᵗ. this morneing came in to
the fleet the soveraigne, victory, and dyamond, out of the river of
thames. yesterday our scouts gave us accᵗ that yᵉ dutch fleet, of all

27. this tuesday the wind hath bine from the s.wᵗ. back to yᵉ s.eᵗ.,
wᵗʰ very thick weather, and then veered to the n.wᵗ., wᵗʰ some tymes
very thick [weather] and raine and wind; all this day very unconstant
weather. this afternoone we spread our red flagg for the severall
divissions drawne out of the fleet to get themselves into a body for
the first onsett upon the enemy; but did not weigh ourselves. our
party out of our squadron anchored to leewards of us, and neere half
way betweene yᵉ dutch fleet and ours. this day yᵉ standard was spread
for the flagg oficers. when come on bord, twas resolved that tomorrow,
about 10 in the morning, the flood being done and faire weather, that
we weigh and atacque the dutch fleet now rideing in the schoonvelt,
steereing with an easey saile upon them; and, in case they go in to
flushing, then to anchor in their places; and, that they stand of into
sea, to stand out with them.

28. this wedensday morneing, being indiferent faire weather, we
prepared our ship; gote upp our sheat anchor, slung our yards, &c. the
wind at west, a fresh gale. by 10 aclock we gote up our anchor, and

french wᵗʰ the body, and yᵉ blew squadron wᵗʰ the south part of them.
to 11 aclock thay rode most of them fast at anchor, not so much as ther
fore topsailes loose. about 12 at noone we bore downe upon the dutch
and ingaged ther van, and the french in the body, our blew squadron in
the reare. we fought till twas darke, tacking to and againe in the
schoon velt. what certaine damage we did the enemy we cannot tell. this
night we sailed and drove out againe; came into 6 fadom watter on yᵉ
oyster banck. by day light we were gote 3 leagues without the schoon
velt.

29. this thursday morneing we anchored in 13 fadom watter by our
judgement, s. b. eᵗ. from oostend, 6 or 7 leagues of. this day yᵉ
prince called a councill of flagg oficers. ordered, that yᵉ respective
flaggs call ther divissions on bord and take accᵗ of what damages recᵈ
yesterday in the bataile. this day the wind blew very hard at s.wᵗ.;
forct us to strick our topmasts and yards and veere out our shot of
cable 2½ without bord. this afternoone, about 3 aclock, the prince sent
away a packet for whitehall, by whome i wrote for london.

30. this fryday the wind blew very hard, most part of the day, at s.wᵗ.
and w.s.wᵗ. towards evening lesse wind. we got up our topmasts.

31. this satuarday forenoone, foggy weather; afternoone, very faire
weather; the wind at n.eᵗ. this day the prince tooke resolution to
shift shipps, ours being so tender that we could not beare out our
lower tire of gunns in the late bataile.

 1. this sonday, yᵉ first day of , the dutch fleet many of
them were under saile, but came not out to us. we gote up our anchor
and came to saile wᵗʰ all the fleet, but anchored againe and birth’t
our selves in our anchoring posture agreed on, to say: the flaggs to
ride n. and south of each other, 4 cables length distant; and the ships
of the severall divissions to ride n.w. and s.e. from there flaggs,
2 cable length distant of one side and the other; the flagg ships as
they are ranged in ther line of bataile. this day we struck some broken
gunns down into hold, and some whole, to the number of tenn, to stiffen
our ship if posible.

2. this monday the wind blowes very fresh at n.e., and did so all the
last night and the day before. this day the prince resolved to shift

journall in the r. soveraigne, , .

this 4th day of , wedensday, before noone, the dutch fleet, then
rideing in schoonvelt, all wayed and came to saile and came out to us.
we wayed with our fleet; put ourselves in the best posture we could;
but, makeing saile, we gote ahead next the blew squadron, leaveing most
of the french in the reare, with our vice admirall. betwixt 4 and 5
aclock the dutch fleet--trump in the van, de rutter in the body--bore
downe towards us (the wind at n.eᵗ., a very fresh gale). we ingaged
till twas darke, more then ½ range of our shot distant. we kept our
lufe; they did likewise the same; would not come close to us. what
damage we did them we know not. on our parts we lost 2 fire ships;
shatterd our ships, many of them, in hull, masts, yards, and rigging.
comdʳˢ killed were: capt. white of the warspight, and capt. sadleton of
the crowne.[a] what number of men slaine in the fleet, know not. this
night we stood to the northwards with our foresaile and mainetopsailes
only. most of the dutch fleet, at 12 aclock at night, tackt away from
us; the remainder tackt after them at 2 aclock.

5. betwixt 4 and 5 we tackt of after them; stood of wᵗʰ 2 topsailes;
put out our jack flagg. called a council of warr to know the condition
of our fleet; found our ships to be shatred in our masts and rigging,
not to be repaired in the sea; our powder and shot the greatest part
spent in two batailes. haveing no shot in the fleet for recrute, twas
resolved by the prince, for the more expedition (_sic_) fitting the
fleet out againe, to saile for the buoy of the nore. we tackt; stood in
for the shore, seeing laistoforland.[b] stood away alongst the shore,
wᵗʰout the sands called alborough knapes. the wind at n.e., we steered
away s.w. by s., haveing an ebb tyde to goe without the shipwash.[c]
the flood comeing upon us sett us in so neare yᵉ sheepewash, that we
were within a mile and a halfe of itt. we hauld of south, and, after we
were about that sand, we steered up the swine.[d] after 8 at night we
anchored in 13 fadom watter, above the gunflit at least 2 miles. all
the fleet likewise anchored.

6. this fryday morneing the wind came to the s.w.; litle wind. we wayed
to plye up, and plyed the tyde to an end. anchored about 2 miles belowe
the midle ground buoy,[e] in 8 fadom watter.

7. this satuarday, 8 in the morning, we wayed; wind at wᵗ. and w. b. n.
we turned up as high as the oase edge buoy;[f] there anchored and rode
all night.

8. this sonday, wind at east, we wayed and ran up to the buoy of the
nore. there anchored, about a mile below the buoy.

9. this monday the wind blew very hard at eᵗ and e.s.eᵗ, with raine;
forct us to strick our topmasts and yards. the wind hath blowne very
hard all this day, and vered back to the e.n.eᵗ.

10. this tuesday, wind came to the north. slaby weather and cold;
bloweing a fresh gale.

11. this wedensday wind at n.wᵗ. and north. this day the king and duke

the last weeke, in a news lettr wrote by a servᵗ of yours, one mr. edmᵈ

by his writeing that sʳ rᵈ haddock wᵗʰ seuerall other seamen were gone

wᵗʰ mr. sawkill, to give you notice hereof, and yᵗ you will readylie
conclude i shall expect satisfaction from him for this scandall, at
least yᵗ he finds out his author or else must conclud him to be the

however the king  please to deale wᵗʰ me (wᶜʰ hetherto hath bine

captain joseph haddock to his brother, sir richard haddock.

                                  abord the ship princess of denmark,
                                     17th xber, . balasore roade.

sʳ richᵈ haddock.

my ever honᵈ brother,

my last, of the 7ᵗʰ augᵗ from visagapatam, gave yoʳ honʳ accᵗ of our
arrivall madras and of our affaires to that tyme. the 10ᵗʰ augᵗ we
saild thence for balasore, wher we arriv’d the 15ᵗʰ; in wᶜʰ bay we
have contᵈ and rid out the monsoone, wᶜʰ has prov’d favourabler then
expected (beinge leape yeare).

the 15ᵗʰ 7ber capᵗ heath arriv’d this place, who, by virtue of the
president and counsell of madras order requir’d my goeinge up wᵗʰ hime
to chuttynutte[a] in the river of hugly (the place where our agent
and factorie resided), myselfe wᵗʰ the rest of the comandʳˢ of the
europe shipps then in the river to assist hime in the rᵗ honᵇˡᵉ compˢ
affairs.[b] in fews days after our getting up to chuttynutte, a letter
was writ to the nabob of dacca (the cheife govenʳ of that citty), who
had formerly requested our agent that if we would assist hime wᵗʰ
ships to transport soulders and horss from chottagam to arraccan (they
beinge in warrs wᵗʰ that kinge), he would give us his pharwanna[c] of
a settlemᵗ of trade, wᵗʰ prevaledges as formerly accordinge to the 12
articles formerly sent hime from our agent &c. capt. heath, in the
letter sent, condesended to the nabob’s request, in suplyinge hime wᵗʰ
10 ships and vessells for the mogull’s occations, to transport ther
soulders and horss, provided they would allow of the buildinge of a
fortyfiction wᵗʰin the river of hugly, for the better security of the
rᵗ honᵇˡᵉ compˢ estate and serᵗˢ; wᵗʰout wᶜʰ grant of a fortyfied place
the compˢ ordʳˢ possitive are, to wᵗʰdraw off all our factory from this
place.

we continued heere 5 weeks for the nabob’s answer to the proposall:
but not comeing, we, haveinge taken off all the honᵇˡᵉ compˢ concernes
from the shoare, saild from chuttynᵗʸ the 8ᵗʰ 9ber, and passed by ther
fortts peaceably. at our arrival balasore found that the govenʳ of the
towne had (some tyme before our comeinge) detaind the rᵗ honᵇˡᵉ compˢ
goods, beinge this yeares investmᵗˢ, alsoe partic. mens goods; and
would not permit none of the factors, nor our people that were ashoure
buying provit[ions], to come off. capᵗ heath sent 2 of our factors wᵗʰ
a letter to the govenʳ (who was come downe to the bancksall, or point
of sand goeinge into the river, wher he was makeinge a fortyfication),
to demand the rᵗ honbᵉ compˢ goods wᵗʰ all our men. his answer was,
what he did was by order from the nabob; and, if he did dilliver our
goods and men, should loose his head. 3 days after, 2 of the factors
were againe sent to aquaint the govenʳ that our intention was to depart
out these parts peaceable, we haveinge come away out hugly river wᵗʰout
doeinge any act of hostillity to any of the mogull’s subjects; therfore
requird hime to send off our goods and people by faire meanes; if not,
we would have them by force of armes. wᶜʰ hee not permitting them too
goe off, the next day all our soulders, about 320, and upwards 240
seamen were put into the small vessels and all our boates; and early
next morninge they landed a mile to the w.ward of the fort (wᶜʰ the
govnʳ had rais’d); against wᶜʰ landinge place they had planted 5 small
guns on a sandhill, wᶜʰ they discharg’d at our men, and killd 2 and
wounded 2 more; soe fled from the guns. and soone after, the cheife
capᵗ of our soulders had drawne all the soulders and seamen in order of
battalia, marcht up to the fort, wᶜʰ, at ther aproach, fired all ther
guns they had planted to the land; but, soone after, the govenʳ and
all his men fleed out the fort wᵗʰout doeing much harme to our men; the
wᶜʰ we possest wᵗʰout any farther opposition. in and about this fort
they had upwards 40 guns mounted and a good wall made wᵗʰ timber and
clay; might have bine sufficient (if manag’d by europeans) to [have]
wᵗʰstood a great armie of men, or at least done much more mischief then
they did.

the govenʳ, after deserted his fort, made all hast possable up to
balasore towne, and orderd the factory house (in wᶜʰ were confind all
our people, thirteene in number) to be sett on fire. our people in
the house defended themselves bravely, killinge sevˡ of the moors;
but by the firsness of the fire were forct to surrender themselves on
tearmes to have ther lives and good useage. the next day capt. heath
(who went ashoare wᵗʰ the soulders--capᵗ sharpe comanded the small
vessells and boates that were to goe over the barr, leaveinge mee in
comand of the ships in the roade) went up with all the soulders and
seamen to balasore towne by watter and landed short of old balasore
fort, the wᶜʰ they soone tooke; soe marcht into the towne, few or noe
people beinge left to oppose them; the govenʳ disertinge it at ther
comeinge, caryinge wᵗʰ hime all our english, amongst wᶜʰ are 3 of our
ships compᵃ, vizᵗ. mr. davenant (beinge ashoare buyinge provit[ions]),
charles scarlet, midshipman, and sam harbin, gunʳ, serᵗ of capⁿ
heath’s, his pursur, and 3 more, mr. stanly, cheife of the factory,
the rest free men that trades in the country. as yet we cannot gett
the govenʳ to give ther releasemᵗ. we have sent sevˡ messingers to
hime, that we have not burnt ther towne nor ships, expectinge he would
dilliver up our men; but, if not, we will returne and doe both. our
soulders (but seamen more espetially) have comitted many inhuemane
actions in the towne, plundringe not only moors but sevˡ portugeese
houses, and killed sevˡ innocent people. we have had the greatest loss
in this axtion, vizᵗ. 4 men killd and 3 wounded. ther names are: mr.
starland, 3d mate, henry grove, cheife trumpetter, christopher hogg,
and jnᵒ hinton, who very indiscreetly went out wᵗʰ sevˡ more seamen to
a garden house, expectinge great plunder, were cut off, sevˡ of them,
by a party of horss. the 3 wounded are henʳʸ roxby, franˢ johnson, and
jnᵒ smart.

i have, by the williamson (by whom this is alsoe intended you), sent
sʳ henʳʸ johnson and sʳ tho. rawlinson, and alsoe to my wife, a list
of our dead &cᵃ men, in all 44. our supernumery men wᶜʰ i brought out
of england, beinge 27, at my arivall madras, i aquaintd the president
therwᵗʰ, who offred them to cap. bromwell, the rotchester haveinge lost
most of ther men. but he refuseinge to pay the charge the honᵇˡᵉ compᵃ
were at sendinge them out, they were not taken out ther; and what of
them that are alive doe still remaine in our ship, not beinge demanded
here by the agent. i supose our owners will be alowed for them at 50ˢ
per mᵒ, noe longer then our departure madras, to wᶜʰ tyme we had lost
30 men. i doe not repent ther continueinge abord, haveinge had soe
great mortolaty and most of them the best of our seamen.

i supose our next enterprize will be towards chottagam, a place neere
the coast of arraccan. the rᵗ honᵇˡᵉ compᵃ possative orders are for
endeavouringe the takinge it; but i feare we shall not have strength
sufficient to effect it, the nabob haveinge sent many thousand of [men]
this yeare ther to over run and take the kingdome of arracan. the king
of that country beinge some tyme since dead, part of the people are in
rebelion against the present govermᵗ; by whᶜʰ its supos’d the mogullers
will goe farr in takeing that country this yeare, and we frustrated of
our designe.

honᵇˡᵉ sir, i have not writt to any of owners (except the 2 in charty
party), beleivinge we shall returne to madras before the williamson
sailes for england. our ship is in a very good condition and very
thite. i beleive our stay in india will be the extreme of our tyme, for
at present noe prospect of a freight for europe; and i feare the brave
trade of bengall will be lost, at whᶜʰ the dutch and french rejoyce,
that this trade  wholy fall to them.

i have not elce to add; only please to present my duty, respects, and
love to all our deere relations and freinds. thus, wᵗʰ my due respects
to yoʳ selfe and my good lady sister, doe remaine,

on the nawab of bengal for past injuries, and to attempt to seize
chittagong. but before the arrival of the forces a premature quarrel
with the natives forced the english to abandon hoogly and retire to
chuttanuttee. in sept. , a truce was patched up, but the company
was not satisfied. an armament was despatched under command of heath.
the result was the attack on balasore, as told in this letter, an
abortive attempt on chittagong, and the abandonment of the company’s

deare son,

i have yoʳˢ of yesterday’s date, from the downes, wᶜʰ brings us the
joyfull tydeings of yoʳ safe arrivall there. yoʳ long passage from
newfoundland put us in great feare of your wellfare, and perticularly
your moʳ hath bine for a month or 5 weekes crying for you and yoʳ
brother nicˢ safety; but blessed be god you are both come well home.
your broʳ now with us came up from the downes by leave from his captⁿ,
and hath behaved himself with so much bravery and couradge that he hath
gained the good report of the duke of ormond, his captⁿ, &c., both in
the action at rotta and st. mary port,[a] and vigo, and was the first
man that borded one of the gallions at vigo,[b] wᶜʰ is come home. i do
not find by yoʳ letter that you were wᵗʰ your comodore at the takeing
and destroying the french shipps to the southwards of trepassa,[c] and
consequently you will not come in for your share of that capture. the
news papers tells us yoʳ prize is got into plymᵒ, and for your boate
wᵗʰ 5 men you say you left behind at plymᵒ we never heard anything of
it, wᶜʰ gives you trouble; and because you write not of my coz wᵐ’ˢ[d]
wellfare, i am conscernd for feare he might be in that boate. to morrow
morning i intend to go to yᵉ admᵗʸ and endeavor you  come into the
river, if his r. highness orders your cleaneing.

god allmighty hath blest yᵉ forces of her majᵗʸ and her allies, both
by land and sea, in a wonderfull manner; for wᶜʰ we lately had a
publick day of thanksgiveing in this citty. the queene, house of lords
and comons, wᵗʰ the bishops, judges, &c. came to sᵗ paul’s church,
where, after sermon, te deum was sung.

since your leaveing england, two of our bord are dead, vizᵗ. mr.
sotherne and my good freind comʳ willshaw,[e] who dyed yᵉ 23ᵈ sepʳ
last. my coz anna babb, that was in one of our almes houses at stepny,
is likewise dead, and my poore cozⁿ lockwood’s son in law, cozⁿ
hodges, dyed lately at gosport, since his arrivall from cadix and
vigo, who waited a tender on yᵉ duke of ormond’s shipp. we are all in
good health, praised be god, and do kindly salut you. i am your most
afectionᵗ father,

pray let me know how yoʳ shipp proves. i have concernd my selfe to get
one of yᵉ 4ᵗʰ rates building at deptford for you, and this day spake
to sʳ geo. rooke about it, and formerly to yᵉ other 3 councill of yᵉ
lord high admˡˡ. i know she is tender by your reifeing your courses;
and twas well hinted in yours to yᵉ admᵗʸ. i am glad you past by plymᵒ.

consarts.

captain edward whitaker[a] to sir richard haddock.

                            dated on board her majᵗⁱᵉˢ ship dorsetshire,
                                  in gibralter bay,  yᵉ 29ᵗʰ [].

sʳ,

i heare give you an accoᵗ of our good success, especially what has
related to my own particular part.  21ˢᵗ we anchor’d here in yᵉ
bay, and about 4 in the afternoon landed about  marrines, dutch and
all. i commanded yᵉ landing with three captaines more; all which was
don wᵗʰ little opposition. about 40 horse came downe from yᵉ towne,
wᶜʰ was all; and they run away soe soon as our guns began to play upon
them. we landed about 2 miles from the towne, in yᵉ bay, and ’d
directly to the foot of the hill, were they posted themselves within
muskett shott of the gates; so cutt of all manner of communication
from yᵉ land. we hove into yᵉ towne this evening about 17 shells. the
prince of hess[b] landed with us and immediatly sent a summons to the
governer, wᶜʰ did not returne any answer tell the next morning, and
then the governer said he would defend the towne to the very last. then
admirall byng, who commanded the cannonading, began to draw up all his
ships in a line before the towne; but, it proving little wind, could
not gett in with them all, so that we did little this day. there was
three small ships in the old mold, one of which annoy’d our camp by
fireing amongst them, having about 10 guns lying close in the mold and
just under a great bastion at yᵉ north corner of the towne. i proposed
to sʳ george[c] the burning her in the night. he liked itt; accordingly
ordered what boats i would have to my assistance; and about 12 at night
i did it effectually, wᵗʰ the loss of but one man and 5 or 6 wounded.

 23rd. at 4 this morning, admˡ byng began with his ships to
cannonade, a dutch rear admˡ with 5 or 6 ships of theirs along with
him; which made a noble noise, being within half shot of the towne.
my ship not being upon service, i desired sʳ george to make me his
aducon to carry his comands from tyme to tyme to admirall byng, which
he did accordingly; and after about 2 hours continuall fireing sent
me with orders to forbare. upon this i went to every ship in the line
wᵗʰ this orders, and coming on board capt. jumper,[d] in yᵉ lenox,
found him extraordinary well posted within muskett shott of the new
mold head, and had beat them all out of yᵉ battery and of the mold, so
that i beleived we might attack it with our boats. i went immediatly
and acquainted admˡ byng wᵗʰ it, who ordered all the boats to be man’d
and arm’d. from him i went to sʳ george and gave him my oppinion that
the mold might be attack’d. he immediatly made the signall for all the
boates in yᵉ fleet, and gave me the command of yᵉ attack, wᵗʰ 3 or 4
captaines along wᵗʰ me. i made all the hast i could with orders to
admirall byng to send me accordingly; but some of the boats got ashore
before i could reach them, wᵗʰ little or no opposition. severall of our
men gott into yᵉ castle; upon which it blew up. we had kill’d between
40 and 50 men. most of all the boates that landed first were sunk;
about 100 or two wounded; upon which, all yᵗ remain’d came running
downe and leap’d into the water, being so mightyly surprized. i landed
within a minute after the accident, and rallied our men. we went over
a breach in the wall but one at a time, and took possesstion of the
hill. i immediatly sent capt. roffy[e] and capt. acton,[f] wᵗʰ between
40 and 50 men, and took possesstion of a bastion of 8 guns within less
then half muskett shott of the towne wall: and there we pitch’d our
collours. soon after, admˡ byng came ashore to me and sent in a drumer
wᵗʰ a sommons, who returnd in about 2 hours wᵗʰ a letter in answer that
they would surrender the next day; wᶜʰ they accordingly did. i beleive
i had wᵗʰ me, at the first onsett, between 2 and 300 men; but we grew
in a very little time to neare . this was the manner we took
gibralter, which i hope we shall maintaine.

i hope, sʳ, youle excuse this trouble i give, butt, beleiving that
every boddy here rights att this tyme uppon this occation, i could not
forbeare giveing my very good friend sʳ ricᵈ this perticuler accᵗᵗ of
yᵉ whole matter; which i dont doubt butt capt. haddock will give yᵉ
much yᵉ same accoᵗᵗ. pray please to favour my spouse with a line or
two, feareing mine should miscarry. my most humble servis to my good
lady and all yʳ good family. i beg youle make use of this as farre as
you shall think fitt, itt being a trew accoᵗᵗ of yᵉ whole matter.

nicholas haddock[a] to his father sir richard haddock.

              sᵗ george in barcelona road, this 1ˢᵗ of , , o.s.

honᵈ sʳ,

this comes to you by the faulcon pink, which is sent home express wᵗʰ
the good news of our releiving barcelona in the greatest extremity.
the french had made preparations for a generall assault that very day
we came; and it must have been infallibly taken, had we not had the
luckiest passage imaginable (being but five days from lisbon to cape
martin, where we joynd sʳ jno. leake).

saturday last in the morning, when were about 5 leagues to the wᵗward
of barcelona, my lord peterborow came of to the fleet wᵗʰ twelve hundᵈ
soldiers embarqued in felucas and boats, and in the afternoon got in
and landed them, wᵗʰ all the soldiers out of the transports and most
of the marines of the fleet. we have now about nine thousand soldiers
in the towne. the french army consisted at first of twenty thousand;
four of wᶜʰ, horse under the command of the duke of anjou.[b] their
loss during this seige is computed to be five [thousand] including a
thousand sick and wounded they have left behind, when they raised the
seige, wᶜʰ was at twelve aclock last night. they have left 50 peices of
brass cannon mounted and 15 mortars, and are now bound to roussilion.
they will find great difficultys on their . the miquelets,[c]
being very numerous and all in arms, will destroy a great many of ’em
before they get out of catalonia, it being a close country. the french
squadron before this place consisted of 26 saile, line of battle ships.
they sailed the night before we came, having intelligence of us by
their scouts. they were all the supply the army had for provisions,
for the catalans have not given them the least; nor could a man of ’em
stirr from his tent a musquet shot out of the camp but they killed him.
we are now sending four ships with 6 hundred soldiers for girone, to
reinforce that garrison, lest the french should make any attempt on it,
it lying in their way.

i hear there is an express come to barcelona from my lord gallaway,
giving an account of his being got to toledo and on his  for
madrid. the lucky turn providence has given to our affairs in these
parts i suppose will be joyfull news in england; and this being the
first certain accᵗ you’l have, this long letter wont seem tedious.

i can expect no letters from you till sʳ clowdsly joyne us, and then
do hope shall hear of your welfare and some good news in return of
all this, which, with my duty to yʳ self and mother and love to all
friends, is from,

sisters are so well recovered by the bath. pray god continue their
healths. sunday last we took this place, attacking it by land and
sea; and almost all the people of it are run up to the castle, wᵗʰ
the garrison, for protection. we assisted our army with 500 seamen. i
have been ashore with 50 of our ship’s company during the seige; am
very heartily fateigued, but very well in health. after we have got
the castle, i hear the fleet will go for the islands of minorca and

intend asking sʳ jnᵒ leake leave for my self.

gentlemen,

in the yeare  i comanded as captⁿ of the royall james, under the rᵗ
honᵇˡᵉ the earle of sandwᶜʰ, in the sowle bay fight. the said shipp,
after a vigorous defence, was burnt by the dutch; in wᶜʰ action i was
wounded, the cure of wᶜʰ cost me, in surgeons, apothicary, nurses, &c.,
betwext fower score and a hundred pounds. i have bine so remise and
negligent as not to demaund satisfaction for my reimbursemᵗ. do pray
the favor of the bord i  have a bill made out, what you shall think
convenient, haveing bine out of my mony now 36 ys. i likewise, in the
yeare  (being then one of the comʳˢ for victualling), was taken
into custody at portsmᵒ, and brought up a prisoner from thence by
order of the then house of comons, and remained as such a considerable
tyme in yᵉ hands of mr. topham, then sergant at armes to sᵈ house,
under pretence of our poisoning the fleet then at sea (under comᵈ of
admˡˡ herbert, now earle of torrington), with gutts in our beere and
gaules in our beefe;[a] and with great dificulty obtained to be bailed.
i must not call it injustice in that  assembly, what they did
to me; but it cost me about a hundred pounds to mr. topham for his
fees, and to lawyers soliciting the house of comons, wᵗʰ expences of
entertainment whilst in custody; for satisfaction of wᶜʰ i presume
the bord will not think fitt to allow me, except directed soe to doe
by order of the lord high admˡˡ, for wᶜʰ shall make my aplication to
him; but for my cure, i doubt not the favor and justice of the bord in
ordering a bill to be made out.

i remain, gentⁿ, yoʳ very humble servᵗ,

i came yesterday to this place, and, according to my promise, do answer

it happens to be this day 40 years that i was burnt out of the royall
james in the sole bay fight against the dutch. am well pleased to find
the efforts you intend to make yourselfe famous in westminster hall.
it is like the saying of your unckle nichˢ, who doubted not but to be
as great as sʳ cloudesly shovell was; and he pushes very faire for
it. your father and family went to wakehurst satuarday last; tooke
betty and fanny clark[b] downe wᵗʰ them; gote well thither. yoʳ unckle
richard, the weeke past, hath bine very ill wᵗʰ a feavor and ague,
wᶜʰ kept me from hence longer then i designed; is under the advice of

his care of him; and was downe staires when came away.

with my harty prayers for yoʳ health and wellfare, i am

my dʳ fanny,

the superbe being orderd from the fleet wᵗʰ the admirall’s letters, i
send this to tell you i am well.

five days ago we had a battle wᵗʰ the spanish fleet off of cape
passaro,[a] on the island of sicily, in wᶜʰ severall of their ships
were taken and some destroyd. the grafton had her share in that action,
and the admirall has been pleased to make me great compliments on my
behaviour that day. i shall soon be orderd to be refitted at port
mahon, the ship requiring it. i had fifty men killd and wounded. among
the former was lᵗ bramble, who was appointed by the intrest of sir
cha. wager. i’m sorry for him, he being a good officer. my cousin
haddock[b] chased towards the shoar after part of the spanish fleet,
when they separated, wᵗʰ 4 or 5 other ships whose signalls were made
for that purpose, and they are not yet come into the fleet. however, i
doubt not but he is well, the ships that they were sent after being of
the smaller sort.

my dʳ, pray send to mrs. harris to tell her her spouse is well.[c]
he dined aboard me the day after the action; he was one of the ships
engaged.

just before we saild from naples i received yʳ letter, and am glad to

my dear spouse,

i send this to tell you i am well. i believe, before this come to you,
you will have heard of my having forced ashoar on sicily a spanish man
of war of 70 guns, wᶜʰ is overset and sunk. i recᵈ some shot from her,
but without much damage. my dʳ, we are here at an anchor, in company
wᵗʰ the kent, royˡ oake, and rochester, to block up camock,[a] who is
at messina and will not venture out, his squadron being much inferiour
to us. by the news we receive from england, i conjecture spain will
soon be oblidgd to accept the terms proposed to ’em; after wᶜʰ i
suppose the bigger ships will be orderd home, where i shall always be
glad to be, whenever it consists wᵗʰ my honour; for, indeed, my dear

served with distinction in the english navy under queen anne, but had
been dismissed on account of his jacobite tendencies. he then entered
