# DD2417 Project

This project aims to predict the year of publication using Machine Learning models.

---

### Models

1. SVM **(SVM.py)**
2. BERT **(BERT.ipynb)** - Note: Please upload the dataset onto Google Colab drive in order to run the code.
3. LSTM **(LSTM.py)**

### Datasets

1. Project Gutenberg **(https://www.gutenberg.org/)**
2. New York Time Corpus **(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tumanovalexander/nyt-articles-data)** - Due to its massive file size (~3GB), we did not attach the file here. Feel free to download it from the website attached.

### Miscellaneous

1. **preprocess.py** was used to preprocess the data from the Books obtained from Project Gutenberg. This includes removing any date-related content, and removing the prefix and suffix that were added by Project Gutenberg.
